Following this, the platelets rapidly change shape and <strong>release granule contents</strong>. This is known as <strong>platelet activation</strong>. <strong>ADP</strong>, which is present in <strong>dense granules</strong>, <strong>causes</strong> the <strong>activation of more platelets</strong> by binding to <strong>P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor</strong>. This phenomenon is called recruitment. The next step is <strong>platelet aggregation</strong>. <strong>GpIIb/IIIa</strong> undergoes a conformational change during platelet activation and allows binding to <strong>fibrinogen</strong>, leading to their aggregation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Local activation of the <strong>coagulation cascade</strong> occurs following the formation of the platelet plug. This leads to <strong>fibrin polymerization</strong> and cementing of the platelets into the definitive secondary hemostatic plug. However, there are certain counter-regulatory mechanisms that keep the process of coagulation limited to the site of the injury. This includes <strong>fibrinolysis</strong>, which is mediated by <strong>plasmin</strong>. Fibrin is broken down during this process and its further polymerization is stopped. Plasmin is generated by the catabolism of the <strong>precursor plasminogen</strong> by circulating <strong>plasminogen activators, such as t-PA&nbsp;</strong>(option A).&nbsp;Furthermore, <strong>thrombomodulin&nbsp;</strong>(option B)&nbsp;binds to thrombin and converts it into an anti-coagulant. <strong>Prostacyclin</strong> (option D) is <strong>PGI<sub>2</sub></strong>.
