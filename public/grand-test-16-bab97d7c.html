The activity of this enzyme is <strong>absent</strong> in <strong>somatic cells</strong> but present in germ cells. This absence in somatic cells contributes to <strong>accelerated aging</strong> and <strong>functional decline,</strong> as shortened telomeres result in cell-cycle exit, hindering the generation of new cells for tissue repair.</p>\n<p>In the absence of telomerase, somatic cells experience replicative senescence, a phenomenon where cells cease dividing, leading to an inability to replace damaged cells. Conversely, <strong>abnormal telomerase</strong> reactivation in somatic cells allows <strong>evasion</strong> of <strong>senescence</strong> and apoptosis, enabling cells to undergo <strong>several additional divisions.</strong></p>\n<p>In <strong>cancer cells,</strong> telomerase is <strong>typically reactivated,</strong> stabilizing telomere length and facilitating indefinite proliferation (Options A &amp; D).\u00a0</p>",

These antibodies cause damage to the postsynaptic muscle membrane and increased endocytosis of the AChR. This autoimmune response against the AChR is mediated by the thymus. The myoid (muscle-like) cells present in the thymus express AChRs on their surface and are postulated to provide the autoantigen that triggers this autoimmune reaction. There is some <strong>thymic abnormality in most patients</strong> with MG. <strong>Thymic hyperplasia</strong> is seen in <strong>65%</strong> of the patients, and <strong>thymomas</strong> are seen in<strong> 10%</strong> of the patients. Thymoma is seen as an enlargement of the thymus in the <strong>anterior mediastinum</strong> on CT chest.</p>\n<p>MG usually occurs in females in their 20s and 30s.\u00a0 Patients usually present with <strong>weakness</strong> and <strong>fatiguability</strong> of the muscles, which <strong>increases on repeated use</strong> or <strong>late in the day</strong> and improves on rest. The cranial muscles, particularly the eyelids and extraocular muscles are involved early in the course of MG. <strong>Diplopia</strong> and <strong>ptosis</strong> are common initial complaints. When MG becomes generalized, the <strong>proximal muscles of the limbs</strong> are affected first. Despite the muscle weakness, the <strong>deep tendon reflexes</strong> remain <strong>normal</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <strong>tests</strong> which are used <strong>to</strong> <strong>confirm</strong> the <strong>diagnosis</strong> of MG include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anti-AChR antibody</strong> immunoassay\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Recurrent nerve stimulation test</strong>: <strong>MG</strong> shows a <strong>decremental</strong> response, while <strong>Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)</strong> shows an <strong>incremental</strong> response</li>\n<li>Block and jitter response on single-fiber EMG</li>\n<li><strong>Positive edrophonium test</strong>: improvement of ptosis on the administration of anticholinesterase such as edrophonium</li>\n<li><strong>Positive ice-pack test</strong>: improvement of ptosis on the application of ice-pack on the affected eye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patients with generalized MG are started on anticholinesterase drugs such as <strong>pyridostigmine</strong>. They are <strong>evaluated</strong> <strong>for</strong> associated <strong>thymic abnormalities</strong> using a <strong>CT chest</strong>. <strong>Indications for thymectomy</strong> in a patient diagnosed with MG include:\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presence of <strong>thymoma</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Generalized MG with anti-AChR antibodies</strong>, even if <strong>no</strong> <strong>thymoma</strong> is seen on CT chest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following thymectomy, <strong>immunosuppressive</strong> <strong>drugs</strong> are started based on the clinical status of the patient.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other options:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Lambert Eaton Syndrome</strong> is a neuromuscular junction disorder associated with the <strong>reduced acetylcholine</strong> (Ach) release from the <strong>presynaptic nerve</strong> terminals, despite <strong>normal ACh vesicle numbers,</strong> ACh presynaptic concentration, and postsynaptic ACh receptors. It presents with an incremental response on repeated nerve simulation test. Approximately 50% of LEMS cases are associated with <strong>malignancy,</strong> mainly <strong>small cell lung cancer</strong> (SCLC).\u00a0</p>",

Most of the <strong>\u03b1 thalassemias </strong>result from deletions of one or more of the total of four \u03b1-globin genes, while <strong>\u03b2 thalassemias</strong> result from point mutations involving the \u03b2-globin gene.</p>\n<p><strong>Types of \u03b1 thalassemia syndromes:</strong></p>\n<p>The severity of \u03b1 thalassemia depends on the number of \u03b1 genes deleted.</p>\n<p><strong>Silent carrier:\u00a0</strong>These patients have deletions of only <strong>one gene</strong> (\u2212\u03b1/\u03b1,\u03b1).\u00a0These patients are completely asymptomatic and all laboratory tests are normal. This clinical state can only be inferred from examination of a pedigree.</p>\n<p><strong>\u03b1 thalassemia trait: </strong>Deletion of <strong>two \u03b1 genes</strong> results in \u03b1 thalassemia trait. There are two possibilities for deletion of two \u03b1 genes, the deletions may be on the same chromosome (\u2212 \u2212/\u03b1,\u03b1, which is called the cis type) or the deletions may be on different chromosomes (\u2212\u03b1/\u2212\u03b1, which is called the trans type)</p>\n<p><strong>Hemoglobin H disease: </strong>Deletion of <strong>three \u03b1 genes</strong> (\u2212 \u2212/\u2212 \u03b1) is called hemoglobin H disease. This name results from the fact that excess \u03b2 chains postnatally form aggre- gates of \u03b2 tetramers, which are called hemoglobin H. These aggregates form <strong>Heinz </strong>bodies, which can be seen with crystal blue stain.</p>\n<p><strong>Hydrops fetalis: </strong>The most severe form of \u03b1 thalassemia is hydrops fetalis, which results from deletion of <strong>all four alpha genes (\u2212 \u2212/\u2212 \u2212). </strong>In this disease, which is lethal in utero, <strong>no \u03b1 chains are produced. </strong>Staining of the erythrocytes with a supravital stain demonstrates numerous intracytoplasmic inclusions within the red cells, which are aggregates of hemoglobin <strong>Bart\u2019s (\u03b34).</strong></p>",

The most common <strong>spontaneous cause</strong> of SAH is the <strong>rupture of</strong> <strong>berry aneurysms</strong>.</p>\n<p>Clinically presents as&nbsp;a <strong>thunderclap headache</strong> (often described by patients as the worst headache of life), neck rigidity, transient loss of consciousness, and no focal neurological deficits. SAH can mostly present with&nbsp;<strong>fever, positive Kernig&rsquo;s sign and Brudzinski&rsquo;s sign,</strong> as well as mimic meningitis or encephalitis.</p>\n<p>Although sudden headache in the absence of focal neurological symptoms is the hallmark of aneurysmal rupture, focal neurological deficits may occur.</p>\n<p>A painful third nerve palsy is typically the result of compression from a posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Intraocular hemorrhages, classically subhyaloid, may be visible on fundoscopy. The combination of SAH and vitreous hemorrhage is known as&nbsp;<strong>Terson&rsquo;s Syndrome.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>&nbsp;- <strong>Non-contrast CT</strong> head shows <strong>hyperdensity</strong> in the subarachnoid space/ basal cistern, and <strong>lumbar puncture</strong> shows <strong>xanthochromia</strong>. Xanthochromia refers to the <strong>yellowish appearance</strong> of CSF. In a lumbar puncture, a traumatic tap can be confused with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as both show blood in the CSF withdrawn. CT angiography has a high sensitivity for aneurysms and AVMs, but&nbsp;<strong>digital subtraction angiography</strong>&nbsp;remains the&nbsp;<strong>gold standard.</strong></p>\n<p>The treatment of choice for&nbsp;<strong>subarachnoid hemorrhage (</strong><strong>SAH)</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>surgical clipping.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Nimodipine</strong>&nbsp;is indicated to<strong>&nbsp;relieve a neurological deficit</strong>&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;<strong>secondary to cerebral vasospasm</strong>&nbsp;following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

It is lipid-soluble and has a high affinity for cerebral blood vessels and appears to reduce morbidity after subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In patients with symptomatic vasospasm, <strong>triple H therapy</strong> is&nbsp;added as part of the therapeutic regimen. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Induced hypertension</strong>- with vasopressors to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).</li>\n<li><strong>Hypervolemia</strong>- to maintain the circulatory blood volume&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Hemodilution</strong>- accompanying change due to fluid therapy.</li>\n</ul>",
