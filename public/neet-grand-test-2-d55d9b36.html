Sickle cell disease is caused by a <strong>point mutation</strong> in the<strong> sixth codon </strong>of <strong>&beta;-globin </strong>that leads to the replacement of a glutamate residue with a<strong> valine </strong>residue.</p>\n<p>HbS molecules stack into polymers when deoxygenated. With continued deoxygenation HbS molecules assemble into long <strong>needle-like fibers </strong>within red cells, producing a <strong>distorted sickle</strong> <strong>or holly-leaf shape.&nbsp;</strong>Polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin, leading to red cell distortion<strong>, hemolytic anemia, microvascular obstruction, </strong>and ischemic tissue damage.</p>\n<p>Peripheral blood smear demonstrates -&nbsp; Irreversibly<strong> sickled cells</strong>, reticulocytosis, and target cells, which result from red cell dehydration with <strong>Howell-Jolly bodies.</strong></p>\n<p>The major pathologic manifestation is chronic hemolysis, microvascular occlusions, and tissue damage. Increased breakdown of hemoglobin is responsible for&nbsp;<strong>pigment gallstones and hyperbilirubinemia.&nbsp;</strong>Splenomegaly can be seen in early childhood, but&nbsp;fibrosis and progressive shrinkage of the spleen may occur in adolescence known as&nbsp;<strong>autosplenectomy.&nbsp;</strong>Priapism affects up to 45% of males. Leg ulcers may also be seen. Stroke and retinopathy leading to loss of visual acuity and even blindness.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaso-occlusive crises, or pain crises</strong>&nbsp;are characterized by episodes of hypoxic injury and infarction that cause severe pain in the affected region, hand-foot syndrome, or dactylitis.&nbsp;<strong>Osteomyelitis</strong>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;<strong>sickle cell anemia patient</strong>&nbsp;is commonly caused by Salmonella and it most likely affects the&nbsp;<strong>diaphysis</strong>&nbsp;of bones.&nbsp;<strong>Acute chest syndrome </strong>is a&nbsp;vaso-occlusive crisis involving the lungs with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates.&nbsp;<strong>Sequestration crises</strong>&nbsp;is seen in children with intact spleens. Massive entrapment of sickle red cells leads to rapid splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and sometimes shock.&nbsp;<strong>Aplastic crises</strong>&nbsp;occur due to the infection of red cell progenitors by <strong>parvovirus B19, </strong>which causes a transient arrest of erythropoiesis and a sudden worsening of the anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased </strong>susceptibility to infection with<strong> encapsulated organisms</strong> is another risk due to altered splenic function.&nbsp;<strong>Pneumococcus&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> Haemophilus influenzae </strong>septicemia and meningitis are common, particularly in children, but can be <strong>reduced by vaccination </strong>and prophylactic antibiotics. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is also used to demonstrate the presence of HbS.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disease that results from&nbsp;<strong>acquired mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(<em>PIGA</em>)</strong>, which is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG). These cells lack the ability to synthesize proteins that limit the activity of complement. As a result, they are sensitive to lysis by the complement C5b-C9 membrane attack complex</p>\n<p>Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by mutations that most frequently involve ankyrin, band 3, or spectrin (i.e. inherited defects in the membrane skeleton).</p>\n<p><strong>A nonsense mutation</strong>&nbsp;is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon. For example, a point mutation affecting the codon for glutamine (CAG) creates a&nbsp;<strong>stop codon (UAG)</strong>&nbsp;if U is substituted for C. This change leads to premature termination of &beta;-globin gene translation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. The resulting deficiency of &beta;-globin chains can give rise to a severe form of anemia called&nbsp;<strong>&beta;<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;t</strong><strong>halassemia.</strong></p>",
