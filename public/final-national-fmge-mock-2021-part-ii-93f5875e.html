Only some tumour cells will be in the sensitive phase of the cell cycle when the radiation is given. Hence, giving another dose at a later time helps in killing the other cells who were in the resistant part of the cell cycle, thus increasing the success rate of the therapy.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Re-oxygenation</strong>: Hypoxic cells are less sensitive to the indirect effects of radiation. The tumour cells which are closer to oxygen sources are killed first and in the intervening time, the other relatively hypoxic cells can improve their oxygenation so that the next fraction of radiation is effective on them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Repair</strong>: The ability to repair DNA is more for healthy cells than malignant cells and thus when a radiation dose has been received, the healthy cells repair their DNA faster than the malignant cells. The malignant cells whose DNA is not fully repaired are highly susceptible to the next dose of radiation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Currently, it refers to another presentation of urge incontinence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: Urge incontinence is the involuntary escape of urine when there is an imminent need to urinate. It occurs due to detrusor muscle overactivity or detrusor instability. It is seen more commonly in old women with decreased bladder capacity, decreased sensation, and central nervous system (CNS) inhibition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D: Neurogenic bladder occurs in patients with neurogenic dysfunction leading to detrusor hyperreflexia. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, spinal injury give rise to this. They present with urgency or urge incontinence.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On the passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.&nbsp;</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paresthesia:&nbsp;</strong>Paresthesia and hypoesthesia may be noted due to compression of nerves traversing the affected compartment. They are the first signs of nerve ischemia.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pallor: </strong>Pallor of the skin may not always be seen. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paralysis:</strong>&nbsp;Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a <strong>late sign</strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pulselessness:&nbsp;</strong>Usually, the peripheral pulses and&nbsp;capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the <strong>intra-compartmental pressure</strong>&nbsp;using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as the&nbsp;differential pressure (&Delta;P). A&nbsp;<strong>differential pressure (&Delta;P)</strong> of <strong>less than&nbsp;30 mm Hg</strong> (4.00 kilopascals) is an <strong>indication</strong> for <strong>immediate compartment decompression</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong>: The threatened compartment must be promptly decompressed, merely splitting the plaster is utterly useless and the limb must be <strong>nursed flat</strong>, elevating the limb causes further decrease in end capillary pressure and aggravates the muscle ischemia. In the case of compartment syndrome in the leg, <strong>Fasciotomy</strong> means opening all four compartments. Wounds to be left open and<strong> inspected 2 days</strong> later, if tissues are healthy, the wounds can be sutured. If there is muscle necrosis, debridement to be carried out.</p>",
