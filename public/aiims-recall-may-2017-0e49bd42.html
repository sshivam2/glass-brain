The eggs hatch in freshwater and miracidia enter the snails. Miracidia develop into cercariae, which then encyst on aquatic vegetation. Sheep and humans eat the plants, thus completing the life cycle. Most infections are asymptomatic. <strong>Halzoun</strong> is a\u00a0<strong>painful pharyngitis</strong> caused by the presence of adult flukes on the posterior pharyngeal wall after eating raw sheep liver. <strong>Obstructive jaundice</strong> can occur months or years later.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong> is made by identification of the\u00a0<strong>eggs</strong> in the <strong>feces.</strong></p>",
