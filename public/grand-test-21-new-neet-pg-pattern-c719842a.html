The next step in his management would be to prescribe <strong>antibiotics</strong> to treat an underlying <strong>Helicobacter pylori</strong> infection as this bacteria has been strongly implicated in the causation of gastric MALTomas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>H. pylori eradication therapy leads to <strong>loss</strong> of the <strong>inflammatory stimulus</strong> which is responsible for causing the <strong>recruitment</strong> of <strong>lymphocytes</strong> to the <strong>gastric epithelium.</strong> Thus patients with chronic gastritis with known peptic ulcer disease are <strong>presumed</strong> to have been <strong>colonised</strong> by <strong>H.</strong> pylori and require treatment with antibiotics. This also helps in tumor staging, as, if the patient <strong>does not respond</strong> to <strong>antibiotics,</strong> it is indicative of a <strong>higher</strong> grade of <strong>MALToma</strong> which would require more aggressive management.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Extranodal marginal</strong> B-cell lymphomas usually arise at the sites of <strong>chronic inflammation.</strong> Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is not present in the normal stomach but can be <strong>induced,</strong> typically as a result of <strong>chronic gastritis.</strong> H. pylori infection is the most <strong>common inducing factor</strong> of MALT and is often found in association with <strong>MALTomas.</strong> The presenting complaints are similar to <strong>adenocarcinoma</strong> and include <strong>abdominal pain, dyspepsia,</strong> and <strong>anorexia.</strong></p>\n<p>Histologically, MALTomas show <strong>dense lymphocytic infiltrate</strong> in the <strong>lamina propria.</strong> The neoplastic lymphocytes infiltrate gastric glands to create <strong>lymphoepithelial lesions.</strong> MALTomas express B-cell markers like <strong>CD19</strong> and <strong>CD20,</strong> but not CD5 or CD10. 25% of the cases are positive for <strong>CD43.</strong> Eradication of H. pylori with antibiotics has shown to be an <strong>effective therapy</strong> for <strong>MALToma.</strong> Surgical resection has no role in the treatment unless there has been some complication like perforation or uncontrollable bleeding. Chemotherapy is indicated only if the patient does not respond to antibiotic therapy.\u00a0</p>",

Gastrin promotes emptying of the stomach by <strong>stimulating</strong> the motor functions of the stomach, especially the <strong>pyloric pump</strong>.</p>\n<p>After food enters the duodenum, the duodenal entero-gastric nerve reflexes ensure the inhibition of emptying of the stomach. This mainly includes 3 pathways. They are, via the <strong>enteric nervous system</strong> directly from the duodenum, via extrinsic nerves that go to the prevertebral <strong>sympathetic ganglia</strong> and then back through the sympathetic fibres to the stomach and finally via the <strong>vagus nerve</strong> that inhibits the excitatory signals to the stomach at the level of the brainstem. These reflexes <strong>inhibit </strong>the<strong> pyloric pump</strong> propulsive contractions and also <strong>increase </strong>the<strong> tone</strong> of the <strong>pyloric sphincter.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gastrin</strong> is a hormone secreted by <strong>G cells</strong> located in the pyloric glands of the stomach. It is released into the blood, following which it is transported to the <strong>enterochromaffin-like cells</strong> of the <strong>stomach</strong>, resulting in the release of <strong>histamine</strong>, which stimulates gastric hydrochloric acid secretion.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Increased acidity</strong> of <strong>chyme</strong> inhibits the emptying of the stomach by irritating the entero-gastric inhibitory reflexes of the duodenum. It prevents the subsequent release of stomach contents into the duodenum until the acidic chyme that is already present is neutralised.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Distension of the duodenum</strong> inhibits the emptying of the stomach via the enteric nervous system.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Cholecystokinin</strong> secretion decreases the motility of the stomach as a result of its inhibitory effect on gastrin. It is a hormone that is released from the mucosa of the jejunum and is sensitive to the presence of fats in the duodenum.</p>",
