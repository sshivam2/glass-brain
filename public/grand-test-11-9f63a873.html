These include&nbsp;<strong>cytochrome c</strong>&nbsp;and some proteins that neutralize the endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis.</li>\n<li>The <strong>permeability</strong> of the mitochondria is controlled by the <strong>BCL-2</strong> family of proteins, which act as sensors.</li>\n<li>These sensors are activated when the cells are deprived of growth factors and other survival signals are exposed to agents that damage the DNA or accumulate a large number of misfolded proteins.</li>\n<li>These activated sensors,&nbsp;in turn, activate the&nbsp;<strong>proapoptotic molecules</strong>,&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>BAX</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>BAK</strong>, which form channels in the mitochondrial membrane, through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol and cause activation of&nbsp;<strong>caspase-9</strong>, which in turn leads to the activation of the caspase cascade and, eventually, apoptosis of the cell.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, if all the growth factors and other survival signals are present, then they produce more&nbsp;<strong>antiapoptotic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>members</strong>&nbsp;of the BH1-4 family like the&nbsp;<strong>BCL2, MCL 1,</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>BCL</strong>-<strong>XL</strong>. These proteins limit the escape of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The death-receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death receptors are surface molecules that are members of the<strong>&nbsp;tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family</strong>&nbsp;like the&nbsp;<strong>TNF 1</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Fas (CD 95).</strong></li>\n<li>These receptors are expressed on the surface of many cells and can trigger apoptosis. In the cytoplasmic region, these receptors have a death domain.</li>\n<li><strong>Fas ligand (FasL)</strong>&nbsp;is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T-lymphocytes. <strong>Fas-FasL</strong> interactions are required for thymic medullary negative selection. Defective interactions also cause <strong>autoimmune</strong> <strong>lymphoproliferative</strong> <strong>syndrome</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When these T-cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL, their cytoplasmic death domains form a binding site for an adaptor protein called&nbsp;Fas-associated death domain (<strong>FADD</strong>).</li>\n<li>These,&nbsp;in turn, recruit and activate&nbsp;<strong>caspase-8 and -10</strong>.</li>\n<li>In many cell types, caspase-8 and -10 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called&nbsp;<strong>Bid</strong>, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway.</li>\n<li>The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell.</li>\n<li>Cellular proteins, notably, a caspase antagonist called&nbsp;<strong>FLIP</strong>, block the activation of caspases downstream of the death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologs of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive.</li>\n<li>The death receptor pathway is involved in the&nbsp;elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes and in the killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following image shows a diagrammatic representation of the mechanisms of apoptosis:&nbsp;</p>",
