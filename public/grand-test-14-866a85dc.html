Therefore, they only <strong>inhibit </strong>the<strong> conversion of levodopa</strong> into dopamine in the<strong> periphery</strong> and <strong>not in the brain</strong>. This leads to the increased plasma half-life of levodopa, and therefore, lower doses of levodopa can be prescribed.</p>\n<p>Benefits of combination therapy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This therapy inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in the periphery, leading to <strong>increased plasma half-life</strong> of levodopa.</li>\n<li>Combination therapy reduces adverse effects like gastrointestinal side effects, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.</li>\n<li>This therapy allows for increased availability of levodopa in the brain.</li>\n<li>Fluctuation in motor control, where the patient is alternately well and disabled, occurs on prolonged therapy with levodopa. This type of \"<strong>on-off</strong>\" effect is <strong>reduced</strong> in combination therapy because of sustained dopamine levels in the brain.</li>\n<li><strong>Pyridoxine</strong> enhances the peripheral metabolism of levodopa. Hence, combination therapy with carbidopa nullifies the interaction of pyridoxine with levodopa metabolism.</li>\n<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>A<strong> higher&nbsp;degree of improvement</strong> is seen&nbsp;in combination therapy than in monotherapy with levodopa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Demerits of combination therapy:</p>\n<p>This therapy decreases the concentration of levodopa in the periphery, but increases the concentration of levodopa reaching the brain.<strong> Involuntary movements </strong>and <strong>behavioral adverse effects</strong> like confusion, hallucinations,&nbsp;nightmares, and delusions are <strong>not reduced </strong>after the addition of carbidopa<strong>. </strong>In fact, they are <strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;in patients who are taking levodopa <strong>with peripheral carboxylase</strong> inhibitors.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is because <strong>higher</strong> levels of <strong>dopamine</strong> are formed in CNS.</p>",

The mechanism of action of terbinafine is the<strong> inhibition of squalene epoxidase</strong>, which is involved in ergosterol synthesis.</p>\n<p>Squalene epoxidase is an enzyme that converts squalene to squalene epoxide. Terbinafine acts as a <strong>non-competitive inhibitor</strong> of squalene epoxidase, an early-step enzyme in the synthesis of fungal ergosterol. This results in the accumulation of sterol squalene, which is toxic to the organism.</p>\n<p>Tinea unguium or onychomycosis is defined as the infection of the <strong>nail plate</strong> by fungus. <em><strong>Trichophyton rubrum</strong></em> accounts for most cases of onychomycosis.</p>\n<p>Treatment of onychomycosis:</p>\n<table style=\"width: 337px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 132px; text-align: center;\">First-line drug</td>\n<td style=\"width: 189px; text-align: center;\">Duration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 132px;\">Oral <strong>terbinafine</strong> - 250 mg/day</td>\n<td style=\"width: 189px;\">\n<p>Fingernails - 6 weeks</p>\n<p><strong>Toenails</strong> - <strong>12 weeks</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 132px;\">Oral itraconazole- 400 mg/day for 1 week</td>\n<td style=\"width: 189px;\">\n<p>Fingernails - regimen repeated every month for 2 to 3 months</p>\n<p>Toenails - regimen repeated every month for 3 to 4 months</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It is observed that terbinafine, given as one 250 mg tablet daily for adults is somewhat more effective than itraconazole for nail onychomycosis.

The motor innervation for the muscles of mastication arises from the special visceral efferent column in the pons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>mandibular nerve</strong> is the largest branch of the trigeminal nerve and is a mixed nerve. It gives sensory innervation to the teeth and gums of the mandible, skin in the temporal region, part of the auricle, lower lip, the lower part of the face, anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and the oral cavity. The motor innervation is given to the muscles of mastication, tensor veli palatini, tensor tympani, mylohyoid and anterior belly of digastric.</p>\n<p>The <strong>mandibular nerve</strong>, after supplying the medial pterygoid, divides into<strong> anterior</strong> and <strong>posterior divisions.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Muscles of mastication</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Medial pterygoid:</strong></p>\n<p>It has two heads. The&nbsp;<strong>deep head</strong>&nbsp;arises from the <strong>medial surface</strong> of the <strong>lateral pterygoid plate</strong> of the sphenoid bone and the&nbsp;<strong>superficial head</strong>&nbsp;arises from the <strong>maxillary tuberosity</strong> and the <strong>pyramidal process</strong> of the <strong>palatine bone. </strong>It is inserted into the posteroinferior part of the medial surface of the ramus and the angle of the mandible.</p>\n<p>Its main actions are <strong>elevation</strong> of the mandible/ closing of the mouth, jaw protrusion, and side-to-side movement of the mandible.

In other cases, <strong>serial follow-up with ultrasonography</strong> is done to assess the spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Vesicoureteral reflux</strong> is the <strong>second most common</strong> cause of hydronephrosis after UPJ obstruction.&nbsp;In vesicoureteric reflux, the&nbsp;valve that prevents the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter is defective;&nbsp;hence, abnormal <strong>backflow of urine</strong> occurs <strong>from</strong> the&nbsp;<strong>bladder</strong> into the <strong>ureter</strong>. It may also present with hydronephrosis; however, the distal ureter is also involved, unlike in this case.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Ureterocele</strong> is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, thought to result from the persistence of the membrane between the ureteral bud and urogenital sinus. Since the distal urinary tract is normal-looking in this case, this diagnosis is unlikely.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Posterior urethral valve</strong> is an <strong>obstructing membrane</strong> in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in-utero&nbsp;development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. As a result, bilateral hydronephrosis and bladder dilatation is seen, unlike the unilateral involvement in this case.</p>",
