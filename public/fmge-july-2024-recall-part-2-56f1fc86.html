It predominantly shows a <strong>stimulatory effect</strong> hence causing tachycardia, increased cardiac output, and increased systemic and pulmonary hypertension.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>respiratory system</strong>, it has a <strong>bronchodilator effect</strong> on bronchial smooth muscles. It <strong>increases salivary secretion</strong> and <strong>bronchial secretion</strong>. It also acts on other systems and <strong>increases </strong>the<strong> intracranial </strong>and<strong> intraocular pressures</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ketamine is the <strong>intravenous agent of choice</strong> for patients with <strong>shock, low cardiac output states,</strong> and reactive airway diseases.</li>\n<li>It is also used in patients with <strong>congenital heart diseases,</strong> especially with right-to-left shunts</li>\n<li>Perioperative analgesia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ketamine should be avoided in patients with a history of seizures, psychiatric illness, or vascular aneurysms.

Induction dose is usually 1-2 mg/ kg and the maintenance dose is 100-200 \u00b5g/ kg/ min. Propofol is formulated as a <strong>lipid emulsion</strong> and appears as a <strong>milky white liquid.</strong> It has <strong>antiemetic</strong> properties which help reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Midazolam</strong> is a <strong>benzodiazepine</strong> that facilitates <strong>GABA-A receptors</strong>' action by increasing the frequency of opening of <strong>GABA-mediated chloride channels.</strong> It is used in <strong>treating seizures</strong> and is used in <strong>daycare surgeries</strong> as an induction agent due to its short half-life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Thiopentone sodium</strong> belongs to the <strong>barbiturate</strong> group which acts on the<strong> GABA-A receptors</strong>. This site is separate from the GABA-A site to which benzodiazepines bind.

The goal is to<strong> screen newborn babies before 1 month of age,</strong> diagnose hearing loss before 3 months of age and start intervention as early as possible, or latest by 6 months of age.</p>\n<p>In India, a <strong>two-stage screening protocol</strong> is followed according to which infants are <strong>screened first with otoacoustic emissions (OAE). </strong>Infants who fail the OAE are screened with<strong> auditory brainstem response (ABR)</strong> or <strong>Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA),</strong> which is also the definitive test. All babies kept in NICU must be screened by BERA test as per the protocol.</p>\n<p>The first screening is usually conducted <strong>at birth or before discharge.</strong> Conducting the first screening before discharge is preferred to ensure better coverage and reduce loss to follow-up. A second screening is scheduled anytime between 1\u20133 weeks or during the next scheduled visit at 6 weeks.\u00a0<br />All babies with abnormal BERA should undergo detailed ENT evaluation and hearing-aid fitting (cochlear implants) and auditory rehabilitation must be done before 6 months of age.</p>",

The scenario described involves difficulty after the head is delivered, specifically with the shoulders, which is not characteristic of face presentation.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Occipito-sacral arrest-</strong> This refers to the baby being in a <strong>persistent occiput posterior position</strong> (with the baby facing up towards the mother\u2019s abdomen rather than down). Labor may progress more slowly or stop when the baby\u2019s head fails to rotate and descend properly. However, like with CPD, occipito-sacral arrest typically results in <strong>difficulty before the head is delivered, not after. </strong>If the head has been delivered but the shoulders are stuck, it indicates a different issue.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Cephalopelvic disproportion(CPD)</strong> - CPD occurs when the baby's head or body is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis. This can lead to labor not progressing or being arrested before the baby\u2019s head is fully delivered. In CPD,<strong> labor arrest or failure to descend is seen</strong>, and the baby\u2019s <strong>head may not pass through the pelvis at all.</strong> Since in the scenario described above, the head is already delivered and the shoulders are the issue, CPD is less likely to be the cause.</p>",
