The clinical features of <strong>neurocysticercosis</strong> include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Features of <strong>increased intracranial tension</strong> like<strong> headache, nausea,</strong> ataxia, confusion, papilloedema, and altered mental status</li>\n<li><strong>Epilepsy</strong></li>\n<li>Hydrocephalus</li>\n<li>Psychiatric disturbances</li>\n<li>Meningoencephalitis</li>\n<li>Transient paresis</li>\n<li>Behavioral disorders</li>\n<li>Aphasia</li>\n<li>Visual disturbances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Definitive diagnosis of cysticercosis is by <strong>biopsy</strong> of the lesion and its microscopic examination to show the <strong>invaginated scolex</strong> with suckers and hooks. <strong>Neuroimaging</strong> criteria include detection of <strong>dead calcified cysts</strong> by <strong>CT scan</strong> of brain. The cysticercal lesions appear as a\u00a0<strong>small ring like</strong> <strong>hypodensities</strong> with a <strong>bright central spot</strong>.
