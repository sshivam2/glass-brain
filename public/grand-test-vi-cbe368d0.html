This type of horizontal gene transfer may occur by two mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lytic cycle&nbsp;</strong>- In the lytic cycle, also known as the virulent cycle, a large number of progeny phages build up inside the host bacterium; eventually, the host cell ruptures, releasing the bacteriophages. Some of the bacteriophages will now contain bacterial DNA, which can then be transferred to other bacteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Lysogenic cycle&nbsp;</strong>- In the temperate or non-lytic cycle, the host bacterium is not lysed. Rather, the phage DNA becomes integrated with the bacterial chromosome. This phage DNA multiplies with the host cell and is transferred to daughter cells.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Transposition</strong>&nbsp;is a process of gene transfer that involves special segments of DNA called transposons (jumping genes).</p>",
