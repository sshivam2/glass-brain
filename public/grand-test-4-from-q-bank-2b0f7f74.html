Examining for objective evidence of a leak:\n<ul>\n<li>The patient is asked to squat over a preweighed absorbent pad and is asked to cough and strain.</li>\n<li>The patient is placed in a lithotomy position and asked to cough and strain for further evidence of a leak.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Cotton swab</strong> <strong>stick test (Option B):&nbsp;</strong>A Q tip cotton swab is introduced into the urethra. Initially, the tip of the swab would be horizontal to the floor. Upon straining, in patients without GSI, the tip of the swab would not shift more than 10-15 degrees above the horizontal. In patients with GSI, the tip might go beyond 50-70 degrees from the horizontal.</li>\n<li><strong>Marshall and Bonney test (Option D): </strong>The region of the bladder neck is elevated.

The methylene blue dye is instilled into the bladder through a rubber catheter and the patient is asked to walk for about 5 minutes. She is then asked to lie down and the swabs are inspected. If the swabs are stained with urine and not with the dye, it is indicative of a ureteric fistula. If the lowermost swab is stained blue, it is indicative of a urethral fistula.

Though it points to an underlying medical condition, in reality, it arises due to&nbsp;<strong>psychological factors</strong>. The symptoms are&nbsp;<strong>not intentionally produced</strong>&nbsp;and the gain obtained is primarily psychological.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It can be associated with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and somatization disorders. Paralysis,&nbsp;<strong>blindness</strong>, and mutism are the most frequently seen conversion disorder symptoms. Anesthesia and paresthesia of the extremities, abnormal movements, and gait disturbance are the other features commonly seen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Somatic symptom disorder</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by the fear of having a serious illness based on the person's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. The symptoms are persistent for&nbsp;<strong>over 6 months.&nbsp;</strong>It equally affects men and women and is commonly seen in the&nbsp;<strong>third decade</strong>&nbsp;of life. It is associated with&nbsp;<strong>poor insight.</strong>&nbsp;Patients believe that they have a serious disease that has not yet been detected and they can&shy;not be persuaded otherwise. Their convictions persist despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and reassurances from doctors.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Dysthymic&nbsp;disorder&nbsp;</strong>is the presence of a <strong>persistently depressed mood</strong> that lasts most of the day and is continuous. There are also feelings of guilt, irritability, and anger associated with it. These symptoms are present for <strong>at least 2 years</strong>.&nbsp;It is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that patients mention that they have always been depressed.
