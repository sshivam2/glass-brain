Therefore, a defect in this enzyme results in increased accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), and 11-deoxycortisol, and decreased production of&nbsp;corticosterone and cortisol.

Therefore, if this enzyme is deficient, there is an increased accumulation of the precursors and decreased production of cortisol and aldosterone.

The primary function of miRNA is to modulate the translation of target mRNAs into their corresponding proteins. After the target RNA is transcribed from its gene (post-transcriptional), the miRNA may either induce mRNA cleavage or repress its translation. This is referred to as <strong>gene silencing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RNA interference(RNAi)</strong> is a biological process in which miRNA/siRNA molecules inhibit gene expression by neutralizing targeted mRNAs.The&nbsp;microRNA&nbsp;(miRNA) belongs to a group of&nbsp;non-coding genes.&nbsp;The miRNA genes are transcribed but not translated into proteins.

Clinical features include diarrhea, restlessness, agitation, hyperreflexia, autonomic instability with fluctuations in vital signs, myoclonus, seizures, hyperthermia, uncontrollable shivering, rigidity, delirium, coma, status epilepticus, cardiovascular collapse, and death.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&nbsp;can occur with any drug that increases serum serotonin levels like <strong>MAOIs</strong> (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), <strong>SSRIs</strong> (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), <strong>SNRIs</strong> (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), <strong>TCAs</strong> (tricyclic antidepressants), <strong>tramadol, ondansetron, triptans, linezolid, MDMA</strong> (amphetamine), <strong>dextromethorphan,</strong> etc.</p>\n<p>It is treated with&nbsp;<strong>cyproheptadine (5-HT2 receptor antagonist).</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option (A): <strong>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)&nbsp;</strong>is a rare condition that occurs on administration of neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs. It presents with <strong>autonomic instability, hyperpyrrexia, rigidity, and delirium</strong>. Sustained rigidity leads to muscle breakdown and elevated creatinine kinase levels. NMS will <strong>not</strong> show the <strong>hyperreflexia </strong>and<strong> clonus</strong> seen in serotonin syndrome. The causative <strong>drug should be stopped</strong> immediately and <strong>treatment</strong> can be started with <strong>dantrolene</strong> and <strong>bromocriptine.</strong></p>\n<p>Option (C): <strong>Anticholinergic syndrome&nbsp;</strong>can occur due to concurrent use or use of <strong>higher doses of strong anticholinergic drugs</strong> like cyproheptadine or diphenhydramine. It will present with anticholinergic symptoms like <strong>blurring of vision, dry mouth, constipation,</strong> etc. Hyperreflexia and hypertonia would not be seen in this condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option (D):&nbsp;<strong>Malignant hyperthermia</strong> is seen in the setting of <strong>neuromuscular blockade administration</strong> in the <strong>operating room</strong>, such as <strong>succinylcholine</strong>. It presents with <strong>elevated body temperature, muscle rigidity, hypotension, muscle breakdown,</strong> etc. The <strong>drug of choice</strong> to treat this condition is intravenous <strong>dantrolene</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "solution": "<p>In the given scenario, the murmur has<strong> decreased </strong>during the <strong>handgrip.</strong> Therefore it is most likely to be due to\u00a0<strong>hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).\u00a0</strong>Murmurs of mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, and aortic regurgitation increase with hand grip.</p>\n<p>The murmur is <strong>HOCM</strong> is due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. During systole, the mitral valve instead of closing the mitral orifice moves anteriorly and causes <strong>obstruction in the left ventricular outflow</strong>. If the volume of the ventricle is more, then the obstruction is less. Handgrip leads to an increase in the afterload leading to a decrease in ventricular emptying. This eventually leads to increased left ventricular volume during systole and <strong>decreased obstruction.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>A sustained <strong>handgrip</strong> leads to an <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>systemic vascular resistance</strong>, and left ventricular afterload. Therefore it further increases the backflow in mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation leading to increased murmur. A ventricular septal defect is a left to right shunt. Therefore, increased peripheral resistance will further lead to increased pressure in the left ventricle and increased left to right shunt.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic auscultation of murmurs:</strong></p>\n<p>1. <strong>Respiration</strong>- During inspiration, the pressure in the thoracic cavity becomes negative. This leads to <strong>increased blood</strong> flow to the <strong>right ventricle</strong> from the veins. Therefore, the majority of the right-sided murmurs, with the exception of pulmonic ejection sounds are louder during inspiration. During expiration, the lung volume decreases, and increased blood reaches the left ventricle. Therefore, left-sided murmurs are louder during expiration.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Abrupt standing</strong>- This increases the <strong>pooling of blood in the veins</strong> and <strong>decreases the venous return</strong>. It eventually leads to a decrease in the right and left ventricular diastolic volumes. Therefore, the majority of the murmurs decrease with this maneuver. Exceptions are HOCM and MVP.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Squatting</strong>- This simultaneously <strong>increases the venous return to the heart</strong> as well as <strong>increased the peripheral vascular resistance</strong> by compressing vessels. This increases the afterload. Therefore, with squatting, most murmurs become louder, but those of HOCM and <strong>mitral valve prolapse (MVP)</strong> usually soften.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Valsalva maneuver</strong>- There are 4 phases in the Valsalva maneuver.\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"bulletIndent1\">Phase 1- There is a transient increase in the cardiac output due to an increase in the intrathoracic pressure.</li>\n<li class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>Phase 2-</strong> The increased pressure compresses the veins resulting in <strong>decreased venous return</strong> and the stroke volume</li>\n<li class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">Phase 3- T</span>here is a further reduction in left ventricular volume due to expansion of the pulmonary vascular bed</li>\n<li class=\"bulletIndent1\">Phase 4- Resumption of normal venous return to the heart stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Auscultation of murmurs is done in phase 2. The majority of the murmurs decrease in intensity with exception of HOCM and MVP.\u00a0</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Handgrip</strong>- Sustained handgrip increases the left ventricular afterload. It increases the murmurs of\u00a0mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, and ventricular septal defect. It decreases the murmur of HOCM and MVP.</p>\n<p>Note- Similarly to HOCM, the murmur of mitral valve prolapse also increase when there is a decrease in the ventricular volume and vice versa.</p>",

It is located in <strong>medulla</strong>. Therefore damage to medulla results in <strong>loss of spontaneous respiration.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pneumotaxic centers</strong>- The rhythmic discharge produced by the pre-Botziger complex is further modified by the pneumotaxic centres. They are located in the medial parabrachial and K&ouml;lliker-Fuse nuclei of the <strong>pons. </strong>They play a role in <strong>switching </strong>between inspiration and expiration. <strong>Stimulation</strong> of pneumotaxic centre results in an <strong>increase</strong> in the<strong> respiratory rate</strong> and decrease in the tidal volume. Conversely, damage to these centres will result in increased tidal volume and decreased rate of breathing.</li>\n<li><strong>Vagus nerve-</strong> Stretching of the lung results in the generation of impulse in the pulmonary vagal fibres.
