    "solution": "<p><strong>Tubuloglomerular feedback</strong> regulates the <strong>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tubuloglomerular feedback </strong>is responsible for changing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to the amount of fluid that reaches the distal tubule. The sensor for this response is the macula densa. The amount of sodium and chloride entering the<strong> macula densa cells </strong>is a proxy for the amount of fluid delivered to the distal tubule. Increased sodium delivery causes an increase in the activity o<strong>f Na+, K+ ATPase</strong> and resulting ATP hydrolysis leads to the formation of more <strong>adenosine</strong>. This adenosine acts on adenosine<strong> A1 </strong>receptors on the macula densa cells to cause calcium release, which causes <strong>afferent arteriolar constriction. </strong>Increased sodium delivery to the distal tubule will also decrease the release of renin and consequently the formation of angiotensin II. This will finally result in <strong>mesangial cell relaxation.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The GFR is proportional to the<strong> Kf</strong> (glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient), which depends on capillary permeability and the effective filtration surface area. The filtration surface area can be altered by the contraction or relaxation of the mesangial cells. Angiotensin II is an important factor causing <strong>mesangial cell contraction. </strong>This decreases the available <strong>surface area </strong>and the<strong> GFR. </strong>This causes less sodium to be filtered and more of it to be retained in the body, thus bringing the body fluid volume towards normal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another mechanism that is responsible for the regulation of <strong>renal blood flow</strong> and <strong>GFR</strong> is the <strong>myogenic</strong> mechanism. When there is an excessive stretch of the renal vessel wall due to an increased amount of fluid, there is vascular smooth muscle contraction due to calcium entry. This prevents undue increases in renal blood flow and GFR when the arterial pressure is high.</p>",
