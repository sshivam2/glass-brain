The <strong>depletion of chloride</strong> from the ECF causes an&nbsp;<strong>intracellular shift&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>potassium</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;activation of renin-aldosterone</strong> system,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>leading to <strong>hypokalemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>The excessive depletion of sodium chloride in CF also affects the acid-base balance. It leads to <strong>increased reabsorption of bicarbonate</strong> by the kidneys through the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger on the intercalated cells. This process is known as <strong>contraction alkalosis&nbsp;</strong>(option D) and results in <strong>hyponatremic hypochloremic alkalosis.</strong></p>\n<p>Cystic fibrosis, also known as mucoviscidosis, is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder caused by a mutation in the <strong>cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator</strong> (CFTR) gene on <strong>chromosome</strong> <strong>7q</strong>. This gene is responsible for encoding <strong>ATP-gated chloride channels</strong> in the apical membranes of epithelial cells, which regulate the flow of ions across various epithelial membranes in the body, including sweat glands, respiratory airways, and pancreatic ducts. The defect in CFTR leads to<strong> elevated salt concentrations in sweat</strong> and the production of <strong>thick, viscous secretions</strong> in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.</p>\n<p>Diagnostic tests for CF include the <strong>sweat chloride test&nbsp;</strong>(option A), where an increased chloride concentration<strong> (&gt;60 mEq/L)</strong> is considered <strong>diagnostic</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels</strong> (option B) are also measured for newborn screening, as they tend to be<strong> elevated</strong>&nbsp;in CF. <strong>Genetic testing</strong> for CFTR gene mutations is considered the <strong>gold standard</strong> and should be performed for all <strong>suspected</strong> cases. In<strong> equivocal </strong>cases, <strong>nasal transepithelial potential difference</strong> can be estimated as an additional diagnostic test.</p>\n<p>The <strong>criteria for diagnosis</strong> is the presence of <strong>c</strong><strong>linical symptoms</strong>&nbsp;affecting at least <strong>one</strong> organ system (respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary)&nbsp;<strong>or </strong>a&nbsp;<strong>positive&nbsp;newborn screening</strong>&nbsp;<strong>or</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>a&nbsp;<strong>sibling</strong>&nbsp;with cystic fibrosis, along with evidence of&nbsp;<strong>dysfunction</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<strong>CFTR gene</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>t</strong><strong>wo positive sweat chloride test</strong> results obtained on separate days&nbsp;<strong>or </strong>identification of&nbsp;<strong>two CFTR mutations</strong>&nbsp;by genetic testing&nbsp;<strong>or </strong>an&nbsp;<strong>abnormal</strong>&nbsp;measurement of&nbsp;<strong>nasal potential</strong> <strong>difference</strong>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The image below shows the organs involved in cystic fibrosis:</p>",
