It occurs in two patterns: the <strong>urban</strong> cycle and the <strong>sylvatic</strong> cycle. <em><strong>Aedes aegypti</strong></em> is the vector in the urban cycle, while<em><strong> Aedes africanus</strong></em> is responsible for transmission in the sylvatic cycle.</p>\n<p>Patients present with acute onset fever, headache, and vomiting. <strong>Jaundice</strong> and<strong> hemorrhagic manifestations</strong> can also be present. Ultimately, <strong>hepatic</strong> or <strong>renal failure</strong> can result in <strong>death</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Torres bodies</strong> are intranuclear eosinophilic inclusion bodies in hepatocytes.

There are no suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming the baby. These symptoms typically develop <strong>3-5 days after delivery.\u00a0</strong>They are thought to be due to hormonal changes, the stress of giving birth, and the responsibilities of motherhood.

A previous classical cesarean section is considered a <strong>high-risk factor</strong> for failure of <strong>VBAC</strong> (vaginal birth after previous cesarean). Hence, it is contraindicated. There is increased risk of <strong>uterine rupture</strong> (2-9%) in such cases. In some women, classical cesarean scar can even rupture several weeks before term.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other contraindications for VBAC include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&ge;2</strong> previous lower segment cesarean section</li>\n<li><strong>Contracted pelvis</strong> or cephalo-pelvic disproportion</li>\n<li>Other obstetric or medical complications</li>\n<li><strong>Prior uterine rupture</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the fetal buttocks or legs enters the pelvis before the head, the presentation is known as breech. Vaginal delivery of a singleton breech fetus can be considered. It can be spontaneous breech delivery, partial breech extraction, or total breech extraction. However, cesarean delivery is considered in the presence of any associated <strong>obstetric</strong> (previous cesarean delivery) of <strong>medical complications</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: An ultrasound will not change the decision regarding mode of delivery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Internal podalic version</strong> results in a breech presentation. It is done in case of <strong>transverse lie</strong> of second baby in <strong>twin pregnancy</strong>. It is not indicated in singleton pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>External cephalic version</strong> is a manipulation through the abdominal wall that results in cephalic presentation. It is usally done at <strong>37 weeks</strong> as it can revert back to breech position if carried out before. However, it is contraindicated when vaginal delivery is not an option and in cases of previous cesarean delivery such as in this case.</p>",
