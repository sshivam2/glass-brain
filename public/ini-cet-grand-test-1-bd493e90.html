For the&nbsp;<strong>first 3 months</strong>, it is used <strong>full-time (23 hours per day</strong>) and then <strong>at sleep time for 4 years.</strong></p>\n<p>The infant must always be examined for associated disorders such as <strong>congenital hip dislocation and spina bifida,</strong> as there is an association between these conditions.</p>",
