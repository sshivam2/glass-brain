The <strong>risk of bowel injury is very low</strong> as the bladder is fully distended due to the retention of urine.</p>\n<p><strong>Acute urinary retention </strong>may be seen in men and women but commonly occurs in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p>\n<p>Other causes of acute urinary retention include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diabetic neuropathy</li>\n<li>Urethral stricture</li>\n<li>Parkinson\u2019s disease</li>\n<li>Multiple sclerosis</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Acute urinary retention is managed by placing a urinary catheter as early as possible. In patients with BPH, a specialised catheter called <strong>coude catheter</strong> may be placed. It is a curved catheter and is useful in passing the catheter through the angulation in the prostatic urethra. Once the curved tip enters the bladder, it is maintained at the <strong>12\u2019O o'clock position.</strong></p>\n<p>If catheter placement is not successful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is a urethral stricture, it is dilated with a cystoscope, guide wires and urethral dilators and a <strong>council tip catheter</strong> is inserted. Or</li>\n<li>A <strong>suprapubic</strong> <strong>catheter</strong> may be inserted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the retention is caused by <strong>hematuria</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>large three-way catheter</strong> with an additional port for fluid inflow is inserted.</li>\n<li>The fluid is infused, and <strong>continuous bladder irrigation</strong> is done to prevent clot formation.</li>\n<li>Note that the fluid should be infused only under gravity, as infusion under high pressure may cause bladder rupture.</li>\n</ul>",
