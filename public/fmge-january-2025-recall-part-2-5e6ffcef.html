Autonomic manifestations include loss of vasomotor control, <strong>postural hypotension</strong>, and cardiac dysrhythmias.<br /><br />Histological examination shows <strong>inflammation</strong> of <strong>peripheral nerves</strong>, manifested as perivenular and endoneurial infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, and a few plasma cells.

Additionally, ALS progresses gradually <strong>without sensory loss</strong>, while GBS has an acute onset and may involve sensory symptoms.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Transverse myelitis</strong> differs from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) as it involves <strong>spinal cord inflammation,</strong> leading to a sensory level, <strong>bowel/bladder dysfunction,</strong> and often <strong>spasticity, </strong>whereas <strong>GBS</strong> primarily affects the peripheral nerves with <strong>ascending flaccid paralysis</strong>.
