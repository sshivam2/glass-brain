This is due to decreased proliferation of erythroid progenitors and impaired iron utilization. Increased <strong>hepcidin</strong> is implicated in the pathophysiology of this anemia and tissue macrophages have increased stores of iron due to defective utilization.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The chronic illnesses associated with \u00a0anemia of chronic disease can be grouped into three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chronic microbial infections</strong>- osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, and lung abscess</li>\n<li><strong>Chronic immune disorders</strong>- rheumatoid arthritis and regional enteritis</li>\n<li><strong>Neoplasms</strong>- breast and lung carcinomas, Hodgkin lymphoma</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inflammatory mediators, like<strong> interleukin-6 (IL-6)</strong>, stimulate the production of <strong>hepcidin </strong>(Statement 2). Hepcidin <strong>inhibits</strong> <strong>ferroportin</strong> in macrophages. This reduces the transfer of iron from the storage pool to the bone marrow, where erythroid precursors are developing. In addition, erythroid progenitors <strong>cannot proliferate</strong> adequately because <strong>erythropoietin levels</strong> are inappropriately<strong> low</strong> for the level of anemia (Statement 3).</p>\n<p>Clinical features include mild anemia, with the symptoms of the underlying disease. The red cells may be normocytic and normochromic, or hypochromic and microcytic. <strong>Increased</strong> <strong>storage</strong> of iron in marrow macrophages (Statement 4), <strong>high serum ferritin,</strong> and a <strong>decreased total iron-binding capacity</strong> are seen in this type of anemia.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other statements</p>\n<p><strong>Low serum ferritin</strong> and <strong>high total iron binding capacity</strong> are seen in <strong>iron deficiency anemia</strong>.(Statement 1)</p>\n<p>Peripheral blood smear showing <strong>macrocytic red blood cells</strong> are seen in conditions like <strong>megaloblastic anemia</strong>(deficiency of vitamin b12), <strong>liver disease</strong>, <strong>hypothyroidism</strong>, <strong>cytotoxic drugs</strong> etc. (Statement 5)</p>",

The yeast form occurs mainly in tissues at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C and the mycelial form occurs in the soil at 25 \u00b0C. At room temperature, white, cottony, mycelial growth appears, with large (8-20 \u03bc) thick-walled, spherical spores with <strong>tubercles</strong> (finger-like projections called tuberculate spores). Transmission is mainly via inhalation of microconidia. Treatment involves liposomal amphotericin B, \u00a0followed by itraconazole for at least 12 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: Chest X-ray can show findings suggestive of histoplasmosis, such as lung nodules, cavitations, or hilar adenopathy. However, these findings are not specific and can be seen in other lung diseases.</p>\n<p>Option C: Serological tests can detect antibodies against Histoplasma capsulatum in the blood. However, these tests can be positive even in people who have had a past infection and are not currently sick. They can also be negative in people with early or disseminated histoplasmosis.</p>\n<p>Option D: Urine antigen detection is a newer test that can detect Histoplasma antigen in the urine. This test is less invasive than tissue culture but is not as specific or sensitive.</p>",
