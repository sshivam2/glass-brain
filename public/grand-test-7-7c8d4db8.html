Recurrent infections, absence of mature B cells, reduced immunoglobulins, and<strong> hypoplastic germinal centers</strong> point to a diagnosis of <strong>X-linked agammaglobulinemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>X-linked agammaglobulinemia (<strong>Bruton agammaglobulinemia</strong>) is an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by<strong> </strong>the failure of<strong> B-cell precursors</strong> (pro-B and pre-B cells) to<strong> </strong>develop<strong> </strong>into<strong> </strong>mature B-cells<strong>.</strong> It is caused by a<strong> </strong>mutation<strong> </strong>in a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase called<strong> Bruton tyrosine kinase</strong> (Btk) located on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq21.22). The features of the disease are -\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mature B cells and plasma cells</strong> are <strong>absent </strong>or markedly reduced</li>\n<li><strong>Decreased</strong> levels of all classes of <strong>Immunoglobulins</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Germinal centers </strong>are <strong>underdeveloped</strong> in lymph nodes, peyer's patches, and tonsils</li>\n<li>T-cell-mediated reactions are normal</li>\n<li>The disease usually becomes apparent after<strong> 6 months </strong>of age since it is masked by the presence of maternal antibodies until 6 months of age.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The patient has recurrent pharyngitis, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus</em>, and <em>Hemophilus influenzae</em>. Gastrointestinal infections can occur by viruses or <em>Giardia lamblia</em> due to reduced IgA secretion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <strong>treatment </strong>is replacement therapy<strong> </strong>with<strong> </strong>immunoglobulins in the form of prophylactic <strong>intravenous IgG therapy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong>\u00a0</strong>DiGeorge syndrome<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">\u00a0is a disease caused by the\u00a0failure to develop</span><strong>\u00a0third and fourth pharyngeal pouches</strong>.

It has <strong>elevated levels of IgM</strong>\u00a0and decreased/negligible levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong>\u00a0</strong>SCID has defects in both <strong>humoral</strong> and <strong>cell-mediated immunity</strong>.

Most of the cases occur after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. GBS is caused when immune response/antibodies are produced against external antigens like infections (<em><strong>Campylobacter jejuni</strong>, Mycoplasma pneumoniae,</em> HHV) and vaccines (<em>Influenza</em>). These autoantibodies target similar proteins present in the person's nervous tissue (called <strong>molecular mimicry</strong>).</p>\n<p>The usual presentation is symmetrical, ascending paralysis evolving over hours to a few days. The legs are usually more affected than the arms. Lower cranial nerves are also frequently involved, causing <strong>bulbar weakness </strong>and difficulty in maintaining an airway and handling secretions.</p>\n<p>Sensations carried by large myelinated fibers like deep tendon reflexes and proprioception are also affected. Pain and temperature sensations are relatively preserved. Pain in the neck, shoulder, back, buttocks, and thighs is a common complaint in the early phase of the disease. The pain is usually aching or throbbing in nature. <strong>Autonomic involvement</strong> is also frequent in patients with GBS and usually presents with loss of vasomotor control with wide fluctuations in blood pressure and postural hypotension.</p>\n<p>The patient is likely to have clinical worsening during the first four weeks following the onset of weakness. After this, the symptoms plateau, and any further deterioration is unlikely.

Bacteriophages are responsible for gene transfer in bacteria by <strong>transduction</strong>, not transformation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bacteriophages are special viruses that <strong>infect bacteria</strong>. They are composed of a protein coat that usually encloses a<strong> </strong>linear DNA genome. Bacteriophages have a variety of shapes, including spheres, rods, and filaments.

For example, the phage mediating toxicity in <strong>Diphtheria</strong> infects the bacterium and confers toxin-producing ability to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Transduction</strong> is a method of genetic transfer that occurs in bacteria infected by phage viruses. DNA copying and incorporation into the new phages produced in a lytic cycle is not a perfect process, and some of the bacterial genomes may be<strong> incorporated </strong>and<strong> </strong>transferred<strong> </strong>along with the phage. This is the basis of transduction. This transferred genome may be generalized or restricted to specific fragments. An image depicting gene transfer by transduction is shown below:</p>",
