    "solution": "<p>A <strong>vitamin B12</strong>/cobalamin deficiency is most likely seen in him.</p>\n<p>The given clinical&nbsp;features of&nbsp;<strong>peripheral neuropathy</strong>, peripheral smear finding of&nbsp;<strong>macrocytic anemia</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>hypersegmented neutrophils, methylmalonic acid excretion</strong> in the urine,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and history of <strong>metformin</strong> intake after being diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus indicate a <strong>vitamin B12&nbsp;deficiency.<br /></strong></p>\n<p>Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is a water-soluble vitamin that is derived from animal products such as red meat, dairy, and eggs. Its absorption in the <strong>terminal ileum</strong> is facilitated by the presence of&nbsp;<strong>intrinsic factor</strong>, produced by parietal cells in the stomach. There are two vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzymes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Methionine synthase</strong>&nbsp;(homocysteine methyltransferase): Catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine.</li>\n<li><strong>Methylmalonyl CoA mutase</strong>: methylmalonyl CoA, formed as an intermediate in the catabolism of valine, isoleucine, and propionyl CoA is converted to succinyl CoA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The activity of methylmalonyl CoA mutase is greatly reduced in vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to an accumulation of <strong>methylmalonic acid</strong> and its <strong>excretion in urine</strong>. Since vitamin B12 is also linked to the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine, its deficiency can result in&nbsp;<strong>hyperhomocysteinemia</strong>&nbsp;as well.</p>\n<p>Risk factors for B12 deficiency include gastric atrophy (<strong>pernicious anemia</strong>), terminal ileal disease, strict vegetarianism, acid-reducing drugs (e.g., H2 blockers), and&nbsp;prolonged use of <strong>metformin</strong>.&nbsp;The interference by metformin on calcium-dependent membrane action is responsible for vitamin B12-intrinsic factor malabsorption in the terminal ileum.</p>\n<p>On examination, patients present <strong>anemia</strong>, fatigue, and pallor symptoms. Other presenting complaints may include <strong>peripheral neuropathy</strong>, <strong>glossitis</strong>, diarrhea, headaches, neuropsychiatric disturbances like&nbsp;dementia, and <strong>subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord</strong>(<strong>SACD</strong>) leading to&nbsp;<strong class=\"ng-binding\">ataxia</strong>. A peripheral smear shows <strong>macrocytic anemia</strong> and <strong>hypersegmented neutrophils</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Vitamin B9</strong>(Folic acid) deficiency can also be seen in patients on&nbsp;prolonged use of <strong>metformin&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;can cause&nbsp;<strong>macrocytic anemia</strong>. Urinary excretion of <strong>methylmalonic acid</strong> differentiates between megaloblastic anemia&nbsp;due to folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>&nbsp;deficiency. Folate deficiency results in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Megaloblastic anemia&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Homocystenemia</li>\n<li>Neural tube defects&nbsp;(spina bifida, Anencephaly) in the fetus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option C: A patient with pyridoxine / <strong>Vitamin B6</strong> deficiency presents with symptoms of seborrhea, glossitis, convulsions, neuropathy, depression, confusion, and <strong>microcytic anemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: A patient with thiamine / <strong>Vitamin B1</strong> deficiency presents either <strong>dry Beriberi</strong> with <strong>predominantly neurological</strong> symptoms like <strong>neuropathy</strong>, muscle weakness and wasting or <strong>wet Beriberi</strong> with predominant cardiac symptoms like cardiomegaly, tachycardia, high output congestive cardiac failure.</p>",
