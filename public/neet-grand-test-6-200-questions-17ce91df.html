Proton therapy can be used to deliver precise <strong>radiation</strong> dosage <strong>for CNS malignancies.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Protons and the Bragg peak effect:</strong></p>\n<p>The Bragg curve plots the <strong>energy loss</strong> of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter.</p>\n<p>The proton is a heavy and charged particle that gradually loses its speed as it interacts with human tissue. It is easily controlled and delivers its maximum dose at a precise depth and can go as far as 32 cm. The proton is very fast when it enters the patient\u2019s body and deposits only a small dose on its way. The absorbed dose increases very gradually with greater depth and lower speed, suddenly rising to a peak when the proton is ultimately stopped. This is known as the<strong> Bragg Peak. </strong></p>\n<p>The behavior of the proton can be precisely determined and the beam can be directed so the Bragg peak occurs exactly within the <strong>tumor site</strong>. Immediately after this burst of energy, the proton completely stops to irradiate and the particles come to rest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Proton therapy therefore allows to <strong>target tumors</strong> <strong>inside the body,</strong> <strong>precisely localize the radiation dosage,</strong> and <strong>spare the patient\u2019s healthy cells</strong>, offering a much less invasive alternative to treat cancer.</p>",

The<strong> hallmark </strong>of inflammatory breast carcinoma is the diffuse tumor involvement of the dermal lymphatics within the breast and the overlying skin, often without a discrete underlying tumor mass <strong>(peau d' orange appearance)</strong>.

She is a current smoker. She has previously had similar symptoms for which she was worked up and treated medically.
