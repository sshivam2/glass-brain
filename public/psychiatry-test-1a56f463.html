It means to gratify an impulse by changing the end goal from a\u00a0<strong>socially objectionable</strong>\u00a0one to a\u00a0<strong>socially valued one</strong>. Sublimation of\u00a0<strong>aggressive impulses</strong>\u00a0generally takes place through\u00a0<strong>games\u00a0</strong>or<strong>\u00a0sports</strong>. Sublimation allows instincts to be channelled and not dammed up or diverted. Hence, in sublimation, feelings are acknowledged, modified, and directed toward a socially valued/acceptable goal so that modest instinctual satisfaction is achieved.</p>\n<p><strong>Mature defense mechanisms </strong>are healthy and adaptive throughout the life cycle. They are socially adaptive and useful in the integration of personal needs and motives, social demands, and interpersonal relations. They can underlie seemingly admirable and virtuous patterns of behaviour.</p>\n<p>Other mature defense mechanisms are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anticipation</li>\n<li>Humor</li>\n<li>Altruism</li>\n<li>Asceticism</li>\n<li>Suppression</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Immature</strong> <strong>defense mechanisms</strong> are usually triggered due to anxieties related to intimacy or its loss. These mechanisms are fairly common in <strong>preadolescent</strong> years and <strong>adult</strong> character disorders. Although they are regarded as <strong>socially awkward</strong> and <strong>undesirable</strong>, improvement in interpersonal relationships and personal maturity can alleviate it. Some of the immature defense mechanisms are:</p>\n<p>Option B. <strong>Introjection </strong>involves taking up features from the <strong>external world</strong> and <strong>making</strong> them a <strong>part of oneself</strong>. Introjection of a <strong>loved object</strong> involves internalizing the characteristics of the object to ensure closeness and constant presence of the object in order to reduce the anxiety associated with separation from or loss of the object. Similarly, the introjection of a <strong>feared object</strong> involves internalizing the aggressive characteristics of the object and using it defensively to have the aggression under their control. Introjection can also take place from a <strong>sense of guilt</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C. <strong>Regression</strong> involves a return to a previous stage of development or functioning to avoid the anxieties or hostilities involved in later stages. This reflects a basic tendency to achieve instinctual gratification or to escape instinctual tension by returning to earlier modes and levels of gratification when later and more differentiated modes fail or involve intolerable conflict.</p>\n<p>Option D. In <strong>somatization,</strong> psychic derivatives are converted into bodily symptoms and tend to react to somatic symptoms rather than psychic ones.</p>\n<p>Other immature defenses include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acting out</li>\n<li>Blocking</li>\n<li>Hypochondriasis</li>\n<li>Passive\u2013aggressive behaviour</li>\n<li>Projection (non-psychotic)</li>\n<li>Schizoid fantasy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Neurotic Defenses</strong> include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Controlling</li>\n<li>Displacement</li>\n<li>Exterternalization</li>\n<li>Inhibition</li>\n<li>Intellectualization</li>\n<li>Isolation</li>\n<li>Rationalization</li>\n<li>Reaction formation</li>\n<li>Repression</li>\n<li>Sexualization</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Narcissistic-Psychotic Defenses</strong> include Projection, Denial, and Distortion.</p>",

The affected mothers are <strong>emotionally labile</strong> and the symptoms include changes in mood, <strong>sudden crying outbursts</strong>, and a\u00a0<strong>lack </strong>of<strong> interest</strong> in the<strong> baby</strong>. They may also have insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and irritability.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These feelings have been ascribed to rapid changes in women's hormonal levels, the stress of childbirth, and the awareness of the increased responsibility that motherhood brings.

The predominant symptoms are <strong>hallucinations</strong>, <strong>delusions</strong>, <strong>suicidal</strong> <strong>thoughts</strong>, and<strong> thoughts</strong> of <strong>harming </strong>the <strong>baby</strong>.
