It is done in order to <strong>prevent the complications</strong> that might occur if the testes continue to remain inside the abdomen, such as <strong>infertility</strong> and the<strong> risk of malignancy</strong>. The surgery is usually <strong>performed between the ages of 6 months to 18 months.</strong> The testes and the spermatic cord are mobilized, the fibrous adhesions around the deep ring are divided, and the <strong>testes are repositioned</strong> in the scrotum, in a <strong>pouch constructed</strong> <strong>between</strong> the <strong>dartos muscle</strong> <strong>and</strong> the <strong>skin</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cryptorchidism</strong> refers to the <strong>incomplete descent of the testes</strong>, <strong>but in their normal path </strong>from the abdomen to the scrotum. <strong>If</strong> they <strong>lie outside</strong> the <strong>normal path</strong>, they are referred to as <strong>ectopic testes</strong>. The occurrence of <strong>cryptorchidism</strong> is more common in <strong>premature infants</strong>. In two-thirds of the cases, the testes will reach the scrotum by 3 months of life; full descent after this time is unlikely. The descent of the testes may be arrested in any of the following positions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abdominal (15%)</li>\n<li>Inguinal (25%)</li>\n<li><strong>High up in the scrotum (60%)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">Undescended testes can give rise to a number of more <strong>serious consequences</strong>. This includes <strong>infertility</strong>, <strong>testicular malignancy</strong>, and <strong>testicular torsion.</strong> By the second year of life, there is a significant degeneration of the spermatogenic tissue. An <strong>orchidopexy done during adulthood (after puberty)</strong> will result in <strong>no significant fertility benefits</strong> and <strong>no reduction in the risk of testicular malignancy</strong>. Therefore, <strong>orchidopexy should be done as early as possible within the recommended age </strong>to prevent the occurrence of these complications.&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">One important <strong>differential</strong> to be considered in these patients is <strong>retractile testis</strong>. Because of the strong cremasteric reflex, the stimulation of the scrotal skin causes the testis to ascend upwards and disappear into the inguinal canal. If it is a case of <strong>retractile testis</strong>, the <strong>scrotal skin will be well developed</strong>, in contrast to the <strong>underdeveloped scrotal skin seen in cryptorchidism</strong>. Further, the retractile testis that has ascended into the inguinal canal can be gently milked downwards, but this is not the case with true undescended testis.</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">In <strong>most cases</strong> of cryptorchidism, the <strong>testis can be palpated in the inguinal region </strong>and thus local exploration and orchidopexy can be done. In cases when the testis is not palpable, <strong>ultrasound</strong> and <strong>laparoscopy</strong> are done <strong>to pinpoint the location of the testis </strong>and plan further management. The diagnostic and treatment algorithm is given below.</div>",
