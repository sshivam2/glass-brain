It is due to the\u00a0<strong>l</strong><strong>oss of function</strong>\u00a0<strong>mutation in</strong> genes encoding the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G-protein <strong>Gs\u03b1</strong>. This <strong>blocks the action of PTH</strong>, leading to <strong>reduced serum calcium</strong> and <strong>increased serum phosphate</strong>. <strong>AHO</strong> <strong>features</strong> include <strong>short stature,\u00a0short metacarpals </strong>and <strong>metatarsals</strong> (brachydactyly), round facies, intellectual impairment, and heterotropic calcifications.</p>\n<p>Although serum <strong>calcium</strong> is <strong>low</strong> and serum <strong>phosphate</strong> is <strong>high</strong> (like hypoparathyroidism), <strong>PTH levels</strong> are also found to be <strong>elevated</strong>, and thus this disorder is termed <strong>pseudohypoparathyroidism</strong>. <strong>Urinary cAMP excretion</strong> is <strong>low</strong> because PTH is unable to act on its downstream pathways.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Vitamin D deficiency</strong> occurs due to inadequate intake of dairy products rich in vitamin D, lack of vitamin supplementation, and decreased sunlight exposure. It results in a mild <strong>decrease</strong> in <strong>calcium</strong> levels, <strong>elevated parathormone</strong> levels due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, and <strong>low phosphate levels.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Hypoparathyroidism</strong> is due to the decreased production of parathormone from the parathyroid glands. It is characterized by <strong>low calcium</strong> and <strong>low</strong> <strong>parathormone </strong>levels with <strong>elevated</strong>\u00a0<strong>phosphate. </strong>Clinical features of hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism include paresthesias, seizures, carpopedal spasm, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and prolongation of the QT interval.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism</strong> is <strong>also associated</strong> with <strong>AHO features</strong>. However,<strong> serum calcium, phosphate, </strong>and<strong> PTH</strong> levels are <strong>normal</strong> in these patients. <strong>Urinary cAMP</strong> is also <strong>normal</strong>.\u00a0</p>",

It allows the fetus to receive oxygenated blood from the placenta as the lungs do not provide a gaseous exchange.

    "solution": "<p>The false statement regarding primary myelofibrosis is that it occurs in individuals <strong>less than 30 years</strong> of age.</p>\n<p>Myelofibrosis is characterized by abnormal production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, in association with marrow fibrosis (scarring) and extramedullary hematopoiesis. It can present de novo as primary myelofibrosis (PMF), a chronic progressive myeloproliferative disorder or due to an underlying disorder such as leukemia or hyperparathyroidism, in which case it is called secondary or reactive myelofibrosis.</p>\n<p>Primary myelofibrosis occurs in individuals<strong> over 60 years </strong>of age<strong>.\u00a0</strong>JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations are seen in the majority of the cases<strong>.</strong>\u00a0Patients present with vague, constitutional symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, low-grade fever, cachexia, fatigue, and pruritus. There might be a history of exposure to industrial <strong>solvents</strong> or <strong>radiation</strong>. Later in the disease, there may be a sensation of fullness in the upper left quadrant due to splenomegaly. Hyperuricemia and secondary gout may also occur.</p>\n<p>Peripheral smear shows the presence of normochromic normocytic anemia and <strong>leukoerythroblastosis. </strong>There is a release of nucleated erythroid and early granulocyte progenitors from the bone marrow and the presence of <strong>dacryocytes</strong>, which are <strong>tear-drop-shaped</strong> red cells.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Early</strong> in the disease, the <strong>WBC count is markedly elevated</strong> up to 100,000 cells/mm3 but later the count usually returns to normal or is reduced, even.</p>\n<p>The chief pathologic feature is the <strong>extensive deposition of collagen</strong> in the <strong>marrow</strong> by fibroblasts. The fibrosis of bone marrow is thought to be caused by the inappropriate release of <strong>platelet-derived growth factor\u00a0</strong>and <strong>TGF-\u03b2</strong>. Early in the disease, the marrow is hypercellular with an increase in the maturation of cells of all lineages but with <strong>disease progression</strong> and collagen deposition, the bone marrow becomes <strong>hypocellular</strong> and <strong>diffusely fibrotic. </strong>Eventually, the fibrotic marrow space is converted to bone, which is called <strong>osteosclerosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Due to the obliteration of marrow space by fibrotic changes, there is extensive <strong>extramedullary hematopoiesis</strong> mainly in the spleen, giving rise to <strong>massive splenomegaly</strong>. Subcapsular infarcts are common and there may be moderate enlargement of the liver. There is no significant lymphadenopathy, though hematopoiesis may occur even in the lymph nodes.</p>\n<p>The complications include recurrent infections, thrombotic episodes, platelet anomalies leading to bleeding diathesis, and sometimes, transformation into <strong>acute myeloid leukemia</strong> (AML).</p>\n<p>Janus kinase inhibitors like <strong>ruxolitinib</strong> and <strong>fedratinib</strong> have been approved for management. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation may also be considered depending on factors like the patients' age and fitness for the procedure.</p>",

As a result, vitamin B12 deficiency can occur.</p>\n<p>Decrease in vitamin B12 absorption and levels following metformin use generally begins around the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;month but clinically observable features of vitamin B12 deficiency manifest by 5&ndash;10 years owing to the large body stores in the liver mainly that are not quickly depleted. Additionally, the risk of developing metformin associated vitamin B12 deficiency is greatly influenced by increasing age, metformin dose and duration of use.</p>\n<p>Therefore, periodic screening for vitamin B12 deficiency should be considered, especially in patients with peripheral neuropathy or macrocytic anemia.

It can occur following fractures (commonly) or soft tissue injuries and is a<strong> localized condition involving the affected limb</strong>. The clinical features include <strong>pain, paresthesia, pallor, paralysis, and pulselessness</strong>. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressures.

Even with the obstruction present, <strong>continued mucus secretion</strong> and <strong>inflammatory exudates</strong> increase intraluminal pressure, obstructing the lymphatic drainage, leading to oedema, mucosal ulceration and <strong>bacterial translocation</strong> to the submucosa.

Central abdominal pain is associated with anorexia, nausea and one or two episodes of vomiting that follow the onset of pain.
