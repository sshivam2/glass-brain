The \u03b2-lactam antibiotics inhibit this last step in peptidoglycan synthesis. They inhibit the enzyme\u00a0<strong>transpeptidase</strong>\u00a0which is required for cross-linking of the peptidoglycan chain. Transpeptidases cleave the terminal <strong>D-alanine</strong> of the peptide chains and form cross-linkages between them. This cross-linking provides <strong>rigidity</strong> and stability to the cell wall.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Transpeptidases and other related proteins constitute <strong>penicillin-binding proteins(PBP)</strong> and, are located in the bacterial cell membrane. \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are <strong>bactericidal</strong>. This is because bacterias swell and burst due to deficient cell walls when they divide in the presence of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. <strong>Penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams</strong>, and <strong>carbapenems</strong> are examples of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.</p>\n<p><strong>Gram-positive bacteria</strong> are more susceptible to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics than gram-negative because their cell wall is almost entirely made of peptidoglycan.</p>\n<p>Resistance to\u00a0\u03b2-lactam antibiotics develops due to the production of the<strong> beta-lactamase</strong> enzyme and the development of altered penicillin-binding proteins like in methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (<strong>MRSA</strong>). \u03b2-lactamases\u00a0inactivate \u03b2-lactam antibiotics by opening the \u03b2-lactam ring. This could be overcome by using drugs that\u00a0inhibit this enzyme. Examples of <strong>\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors</strong> are <strong>clavulanic acid</strong>, <strong>sulbactam</strong>, and <strong>tazobactam.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Fosfomycin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 1</strong> in the image.

It is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor that interferes with\u00a0<strong>dephosphorylation</strong> in the cycling of the <strong>lipid carrier</strong> which transfers\u00a0peptidoglycan subunits to the growing cell wall. It is only given for topical application because of its severe nephrotoxicity when given systemically.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Vancomycin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 3</strong> in the image. It binds to the <strong>D-Ala-D-Ala terminus</strong> of the newly formed peptidoglycan pentapeptide. This <strong>prevents further elongation</strong> of <strong>the peptidoglycan</strong> and its cross-linking. It is used against MRSA and <em><strong>Clostridium difficile </strong></em>infection. <strong>Redman syndrome</strong> due to histamine release following infusion is an important side effect.</p>\n<p>Note: The FDA has approved the use of <strong>cefepime-enmetazobactam</strong>, a combination of a fourth-generation cephalosporin and beta-lactamase inhibitor for use in<strong> complicated UTI</strong>s (including pyelonephritis).</p>",

Empagliflozin and canagliflozin reduce the risk for major cardiovascular events.</p>\n<p>The main side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is an increase in <strong>lower urinary tract infections</strong> and&nbsp;genital mycotic infections. This is because of their glycosuric properties. A recent warning from the FDA says that SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the risk of <strong>fractures</strong>.

American diabetes association recommends canagliflozin as the first-line drug along with metformin, in patients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and heart failure. Even when thiazolidinediones are required, clinicians prefer pioglitazone over rosiglitazone due to the higher risk of cardiovascular-related mortality in rosiglitazone. Therefore, <strong>canagliflozin</strong> would be a <strong>better</strong> option compared to rosiglitazone.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"ng-star-inserted\">\n<div class=\"table-responsive font-weight-light answer-scroll ng-star-inserted\">\n<p>Option B: <strong>Liraglutide</strong> is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist.
