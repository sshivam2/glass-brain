The most likely diagnosis is <strong>hereditary hemochromatosis</strong>. <strong>Disabling polyarthritis</strong> in hemochromatosis is due to<strong> the deposition of Calcium pyrophosphate </strong>which damages the articular cartilage, referred to as<strong> Pseudogout.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hemochromatosis </strong>is caused by <strong>excessive iron absorption,</strong> most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as the liver and pancreas, followed by the heart, joints, and endocrine organs. When hemochromatosis results from an inherited disorder, it is referred to as hereditary hemochromatosis. The adult form of hemochromatosis is almost always caused by <strong>mutations of HFE</strong> located on the short arm of chromosome 6.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Symptoms usually appear in the fourth to fifth decades of life in men and later in women. The principal manifestations of classic hemochromatosis include <strong>hepatomegaly,</strong> <strong>abdominal pain, abnormal skin pigmentation </strong>(particularly in sun-exposed areas), deranged glucose homeostasis, or <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong> due to the destruction of pancreatic islets, <strong>cardiac dysfunction</strong> (arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy), and<strong> atypical arthritis. </strong></p>\n<p>In some patients, the presenting complaint is hypogonadism. The testes may be small and atrophic, secondary to a derangement in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis resulting in reduced gonadotropin and testosterone levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A significant cause of death is hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>",
