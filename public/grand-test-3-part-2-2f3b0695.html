The recommended regimen is <strong>Penicillin G IV,</strong> an initial dose of <strong>5 MU (million units)</strong>, followed by <strong>2.5-3 MU IV every 4 hr</strong> <strong>continued</strong> <strong>until delivery</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Indications</strong> of intrapartum GBS prophylaxis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GBS bacteriuria</strong> in the mother</li>\n<li><strong>Prior infant</strong> with <strong>invasive GBS</strong> disease</li>\n<li><strong>Positive GBS screening</strong> culture in the <strong>current pregnancy</strong></li>\n<li>Positive GBS status in a <strong>prior pregnancy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Unknown GBS status</strong> at <strong>labor onset</strong> with <strong>any</strong> of the following intrapartum risk factors:\n<ul>\n<li>Labor onset &lt;37 weeks gestation (<strong>Preterm labor</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>Membrane rupture</strong> for <strong>\u226518 hours</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Intrapartum fever</strong> with temperature <strong>\u2265100.4\u00b0 F (38.0\u00b0C)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Intrapartum NAAT</strong> result positive for GBS</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Intrapartum GBS prophylaxis is <strong>not indicated</strong> when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patients planned for <strong>cesarean </strong>delivery <strong>before the onset of labor</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>membrane rupture</strong>, <strong>regardless of GBS status or gestational age</strong></li>\n<li>Negative rectovaginal culture at \u226536 weeks gestation in current pregnancy</li>\n<li>Unknown GBS status and intrapartum NAAT result negative and no intrapartum risk factors present</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other options:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: The patient requires Intrapartum penicillin prophylaxis and <strong>not</strong> just monitoring and proceeding with routine care.</p>\n<p>Option C: This patient only underwent a rectal culture, and could benefit from a recto-vaginal culture.
