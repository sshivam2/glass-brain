When contaminated meat is cooked, the spores in the interior may survive. During storage or warming, they germinate and multiply in the anaerobic environment of the cooked meat. Large numbers of clostridia may thus be consumed, which may pass unharmed by gastric acid due to the high protein content of the meat and reach the intestines where they produce the enterotoxin.

Diagnosis is made by isolating heat-resistant C.perfringens type A from feces and food.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Enterotoxigenic E.coli</strong> is endemic in developing countries of the tropics, seen in all age groups. Its severity varies from mild\u00a0<strong>watery diarrhea</strong> to a fatal disease indistinguishable from cholera. It has an incubation period of<strong> &gt;16 hours</strong>. Diagnosis of ETEC diarrhea depends on demonstration of the enterotoxins.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong>\u00a0enterotoxin is responsible for the manifestations of staphylococcal food poisoning-nausea, vomiting and diarrhea <strong>2-6 hours after consuming food contaminated by the preformed toxin</strong>. About two-thirds of S.aureus strains, growing in carbohydrate and protein food, secrete the toxin. Meat and fish or milk and milk products cooked and left at room temperature after contamination with staphylococci, for enough time for the toxin to accumulate, are the common items responsible. The source of infection is usually a <strong>food handler who is a carrier</strong>.\u00a0The toxin is believed to act directly on the autonomic nervous system to cause the illness, rather than on the gastrointestinal mucosa.</p>",
