This procedure is largely obsolete and rarely used now due to problems with chronic perineal sepsis, anal stenosis, and obstructed defecation.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Delorme's mucosectomy</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In this procedure, the rectal mucosa is stripped circumferentially from the rectum over the length of the prolapse.&nbsp;The underlying muscle is plicated with a series of sutures.

Restoration of colorectal continuity can be performed by hand-sewn/stapled anastomosis.
