The<strong> glucose-lowering</strong> effect is <strong>independent of insulin</strong>. Empagliflozin acts as a <strong>diuretic</strong> and <strong>natriuretic</strong> by reducing sodium and volume load, causing intravascular contraction. Empagliflozin is also associated with <strong>weight loss</strong>, with <strong>reductions in blood pressure</strong> without increasing heart rate. Empagliflozin has been found to <strong>decrease the risk of mortality</strong> from <strong>cardiovascular causes in diabetic patients</strong>.\u00a0<br /><br />SGLT-2 inhibitors have a <strong>cardioprotective effect</strong> resulting from<strong> improved cardiac cell metabolism</strong>,<strong> improvement of ventricular loading mechanism</strong>, <strong>reduction of cardiac cell necrosis</strong> and <strong>fibrosis</strong>.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors enhance the release of insulin postprandially,<strong> decrease glucagon</strong>, and thereby<strong> lower mealtime as well as fasting glucose</strong>. Linagliptin is<strong> safe to use in chronic kidney disease</strong> as it is cleared primarily by hepatobiliary system, but is <strong>not approved for heart failure</strong>.\u00a0<br /><br />Option D : <strong>Rosiglitazone</strong> is a <strong>thiazolidinedione</strong>, which <strong>activates PPAR-\u03b3 receptors </strong>in adipose tissue and skeletal muscles. These are <strong>insulin sensitizers</strong> and<strong> increase insulin-mediated glucose uptake</strong> in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The introduction of opium to China occurred during the late 6th or early 7th century CE, facilitated by Turkish and Arab traders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During this time, tobacco smoking moved from North America to China, resulting in widespread opium smoking. Opium addiction and imports increased in the first century of the Qing era (1644\u20131911/12). To address the issue, the Yongzheng emperor (1722\u201335) banned opium trafficking and consumption in 1729. Despite hurdles, the trade continued, and in 1796, the Jiaqing emperor banned opium imports and cultivation. Opium sales survived despite these laws.</p>\n<p>In the early 18th century, the Portuguese made a lot of money importing opium from India and selling it in China. British traders became China's main suppliers in 1773. The British East India Company monopolized <strong>Bengali</strong> opium farming. The company developed an inexpensive and productive opium poppies cultivation method in this location. The US and other Western nations traded Turkish and Indian opium.</p>\n<p>The opium trade was pursued by Britain and other European nations as a means to address their persistent trade deficit with China. In Europe, there existed a substantial and notable demand for <strong>Chinese commodities such as tea, silks, and porcelain pots</strong>. Conversely, in China, there was a very limited market for Europe's manufactured goods and other trade items. As a result, Europeans were required to utilize gold or silver as payment for Chinese goods. The opium trade, which resulted in a consistent demand for opium among Chinese individuals addicted to the substance, effectively addressed the persistent trade imbalance by facilitating the importation of opium from Western countries.</p>\n<p>Opium was not carried by the East India Company. Due to the Chinese restriction, the corporation outsourced it to \u201c<strong>country</strong> <strong>traders</strong>\u201d\u2014private traders entitled to transport commodities from India to China. Smugglers on the Chinese shore bought opium from country traders. The traders gave the East India Company their sales of gold and silver. The corporation spent its gold and silver in China on profitable things to sell in England.</p>\n<p>Opium imports into China rose from 200 chests in 1729 to 1,000 in 1767 and 10,000 between 1820 and 1830. Although chest weight varied by origin, it averaged 140 pounds (63.5 kg). By 1838, China imported 40,000 chests annually. China lost the balance of payments to Britain for the first time. Opium distribution networks had evolved across China, frequently with corrupt officials' help. High opium addiction levels affected imperial troops and officials.</p>",

For individuals <strong>&gt;5 years</strong> of age with sickle cell disease who have <strong>pain despite hydroxyurea</strong> (or who <strong>cannot tolerate hydroxyurea</strong>), <strong>L-glutamine</strong> is recommended, regardless of whether they are receiving hydroxyurea.

In adolescence or early adulthood, <strong>autosplenectomy</strong> occurs due to splenic infarction, fibrosis, and progressive shrinkage.<br />- Increased <strong>susceptibility to infection</strong> with <strong>encapsulated</strong> <strong>organisms</strong> like pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenza septicemia, but can be reduced by vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics.<br />- Other clinical features include <strong>priapism</strong>,<strong> leg ulcers, stroke, retinopathy, pigment gallstones</strong>, and <strong>growth retardation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options :\u00a0<br /><br />Option B : <strong>Methotrexate</strong> interferes with folate metabolism by acting as a<strong> competitive inhibitor</strong> of the enzyme <strong>dihydrofolate reductase</strong>.

    "solution": "<p>In this scenario of a <strong>pregnant woman in her third trimester </strong>with <strong>bipolar disorder</strong> with<strong>\u00a0multiple past episodes</strong> and <strong>currently stable on lithium</strong>, the <strong>best next step in management</strong> is to <strong>decrease lithium dosage within therapeutic levels</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Lithium</strong> is a <strong>mood stabilizer </strong>with a <strong>very narrow therapeutic index</strong> and is the <strong>first line</strong> of management in<strong> bipolar disorder</strong>. Lithium therapy should be <strong>continued throughout the pregnancy</strong> in women who have <strong>severe, frequent episodes</strong>, and these patients should be counseled about the <strong>reproductive risks</strong> associated with therapy. Ideally, the next best step in this scenario would be to<strong> monitor lithium blood levels monthly until 34 weeks</strong>, and <strong>weekly monitoring thereafter until delivery</strong>. However, <strong>dose reduction can be considered closer to delivery</strong> as there may be an increased risk of <strong>lithium toxicity in the fetus</strong>. According to <strong>NICE guidelines</strong>, it is recommended to <strong>stop lithium during active labour</strong>, measure <strong>lithium levels 12 hours after the last dose</strong> and reestablish prophylactic levels after delivery.<br /><br /><strong>First and second trimester</strong> are characterised by a significant<strong> decrease of lithium blood levels</strong> with a risk of subtherapeutic levels. In<strong> third trimester</strong> and the <strong>postpartum</strong>,<strong> lithium levels gradually return</strong> to their preconception level which implicates that in this period clinicians need to be aware of the<strong> risk of lithium intoxication (Option B)</strong>.\u00a0<br /><br /><strong>Bipolar disorder </strong>has been associated with <strong>adverse perinatal outcomes</strong> such as<strong> preterm birth</strong>. <strong>Medication discontinuation in pregnancy (Option A)</strong>\u00a0can pose an increased risk for <strong>relapse</strong>. Moreover, <strong>symptomatic women during pregnancy</strong> more likely have <strong>postpartum relapses</strong> that can be severe.<br /><br /><strong>Typical therapy</strong> for bipolar disorder includes mood stabilizers such as <strong>lithium, valproic acid, </strong>and<strong> carbamazepine </strong>and<strong> antipsychotic</strong> medications. Bipolar disorder during pregnancy is a complicated condition that is best treated in tandem with psychiatric care. Risks and advantages of mood stabilizers, some of which are <strong>teratogenic</strong>, must be considered while making decisions.</p>\n<p>For example, <strong>lithium use </strong>during the <strong>first trimester</strong> has been linked to<strong> Ebstein anomaly</strong>, although very rarely. <strong>Fetal echocardiography</strong> is recommended for <strong>lithium-exposed fetuses</strong>. Fetal lithium exposure is also associated with <strong>neonatal goiter, CNS depression, hypotonia </strong>(floppy baby syndrome), and cardiac murmur.</p>\n<p><strong>Maternal adverse effects</strong> of lithium can be <strong>acute</strong> such as <strong>tremors, ataxia, weakness, polyuria, polydipsia</strong> or <strong>chronic</strong> such as <strong>nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction</strong>, and <strong>hyperparathyroidism</strong>.</p>\n<p>Due to all these adverse effects, patients on lithium therapy should have <strong>routine monitoring</strong> of serum electrolytes, serum calcium, thyroid profile, renal function tests, ECG, and serum lithium levels.</p>\n<p>Other options :\u00a0<br /><br />Option D : It is not necessary to switch to valproate in the third trimester as the patient is already stable on lithium. Use of valproate in the first trimester is associated with significant teratogenicity.</p>",

Functional status refers to the comprehensive assessment of an individual's health effect within the framework of their surroundings and social support network. It encompasses the individual's capacity to do the physical and social tasks required for their typical activities and duties. The constituents of functional status encompass <strong>activities</strong> of <strong>daily</strong> <strong>living</strong> (ADLs), <strong>instrumental</strong> <strong>activities</strong> of <strong>daily</strong> <strong>living</strong> (IADLs), and <strong>advanced</strong> <strong>activities</strong> of <strong>daily</strong> <strong>living</strong> (AADLs). Two often employed measures in the field are the <strong>Katz</strong> <strong>index</strong>, which assesses activities of daily living (<strong>ADLs</strong>), and the <strong>Lawton</strong> scale, which evaluates <strong>instrumental</strong> activities of <strong>daily</strong> <strong>living</strong> (IADLs). The most effective approach for ascertaining AADLS involves the utilization of <strong>open</strong>-<strong>ended</strong> inquiries, such as \"In what manner do you allocate your time throughout the day?\" or \"What activities do you find enjoyable?\"</p>\n<p>There is a growing trend in geriatric assessment to integrate perspectives from non-clinical office workers, patients, and their relatives or loved ones. This collaborative approach may encompass the use of standing orders, forms, and questionnaires. An advisable strategy involves doing an annual evaluation of functional status, <strong>commencing</strong> at the age of <strong>65</strong> <strong>years</strong>, using the <strong>Medicare</strong> <strong>Annual</strong> <strong>Wellness</strong> <strong>Visit</strong>. For individuals below the age of 75 years with multiple comorbidities or those aged 75 years and above, it is recommended to augment this assessment with supplementary components. Furthermore, it is recommended that some components of geriatric assessment, such as evaluating activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), measuring gait, balance, and the risk of falls, evaluating mood and affect, as well as assessing cognition, be conducted following significant illnesses, particularly those necessitating hospitalization.</p>",

This model is the initial proposition aimed at elucidating the mechanism of an enzymatic catalytic process. Based on this concept, it can be inferred that the enzyme's structure or conformation exhibits a state of <strong>rigidity</strong>. The substrate effectively conforms to the binding site, which is now referred to as the active site, in a manner analogous to a <strong>key</strong> fitting precisely into its corresponding <strong>lock</strong> or a <strong>hand</strong> fitting snugly into a well-fitting <strong>glove</strong>.

The substrate's contact with the enzyme elicits a conformational change in the enzyme, leading to the establishment of a robust binding site for the substrate. Moreover, as a result of induced fit, the enzyme undergoes conformational changes that lead to the <strong>repositioning</strong> <strong>of</strong> the <strong>specific</strong> <strong>amino</strong> <strong>acids</strong> involved in the formation of the active site, hence facilitating the catalytic process. The induced fit model has garnered substantial empirical support through <strong>X</strong>-<strong>ray</strong> <strong>diffraction</strong> studies.

It is plausible that upon the binding of a substrate to the preexisting active site, the enzyme elicits a strain on the substrate. The presence of a stressed or <strong>strained</strong> <strong>substrate facilitates</strong> the generation of the <strong>desired product</strong>.

The <strong>diagonal</strong> <strong>lines</strong> depicted in the diagram signify <strong>distinct</strong> <strong>categorizations</strong> of the underlying factors contributing to the issue. <strong>Supplementary</strong> <strong>branches</strong> may also be delineated from the primary skeletal structure to symbolize <strong>underlying</strong> <strong>factors</strong> leading to the causes.</p>\n<p>The groupings are typically <strong>structured into</strong> <strong>categories</strong>, commonly known as the <strong>five Ps</strong> (patients/clients, providers, policies, processes and procedures, and place/equipment), the <strong>six Ms </strong>(machine, method, materials, measurement, man, and Mother Nature), and the<strong> four Ss</strong> (surroundings, suppliers, systems, and skills). Nevertheless, the groupings need to be tailored to the organization and problem being investigated. The responsibility for ensuring this specificity lies with the quality improvement team. Once the categories have been delineated, the quality improvement team proceeds to partake in a brainstorming session to <strong>identify</strong> <strong>causes</strong> that are specific to each respective grouping. The aforementioned procedure persists until the team reaches a point where they are unable to ascertain any further underlying factors.</p>",

This<strong> </strong>occurs due to lesions of<strong> occipito-temporal junction, </strong>which is present in the<strong> inferior temporal lobe. </strong><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Prosopagnosia </strong><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">is a type of associatetive visual agnosia which refers to the </span><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">inability\u00a0to visually identify faces</strong><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The occipital lobe acts as the primary visual area and a lesion in this region would result in cortical blindness and <strong>achromatopsia, </strong>which is the inability to visualise colour. In the given scenario, as the patient is also able to <strong>identify colour</strong>, it indicates that the occipital lobe (Option A) is unaffected and (hence inferior temporal lobe is the better answer).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Stereognosis</strong> is the <strong>ability</strong> to <strong>identify</strong> an <strong>object</strong> by a perception of the form and nature of an object <strong>without looking</strong> at it. In the given scenario, the patient is able to recognize the object from its texture and pattern which indicates that stereognosis is intact. Loss of this ability is known as <strong>astereognosis\u00a0</strong>which occurs in\u00a0lesions of the <strong>superior parietal lobule </strong>(Options B and C) and <strong>dorsal column</strong> pathways.</p>",
