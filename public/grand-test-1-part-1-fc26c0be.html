It is commonly seen in young athletes. The <strong>heart rate increases</strong> during<strong> inspiration</strong> and decreases during expiration, especially when the depth of breathing is increased. This is due to the fluctuations in <strong>parasympathetic output </strong>to the heart.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">During inspiration, the <strong>stretch receptors</strong> of the lungs send signals to the vagus nerves. The vagi then inhibits the <strong>cardiac inhibitory area </strong>of the medulla oblongata. The tonic vagal tone thus decreases, and the heart rate increases. The opposite occurs <strong>during expiration</strong>, with a resultant<strong> increase</strong> in<strong> vagal tone</strong>. The cardiac inhibitory area also receives signals from the <strong>medullary respiratory center.</strong> \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Other options:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Option B: <strong>Cardiac output</strong> is directly proportional to <strong>preload </strong>over a certain range. Preload can be determined by <strong>venous return</strong>, which<strong> increases</strong> in the <strong>supine</strong> position as compared to standing. Thus, the cardiac output increases when supine as compared to standing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Option C: <strong>Degeneration </strong>of the <strong>sino-atrial node</strong> is a cause of <strong>sick sinus syndrome</strong>. It is more commonly seen in elderly people. Sick sinus syndrome includes sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia-tachycardia.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Option D: <strong>Ectopic foci</strong> in the atrium result in <strong>premature atrial contractions</strong> (PACs).

The <strong>secretion</strong> of<strong> protons</strong> by an activated <strong>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase</strong> (proton pump) in the <strong>parietal cells</strong> into the gastric lumen is the <strong>final step</strong> involved in the production of<strong> gastric acid</strong>&nbsp;and inhibition of this enzyme prevents acid secretion into the stomach.</p>\n<p>Once PPIs irreversibly inactivate the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane. This leads to <strong>prolonged suppression of acid secretion</strong> for up to 24-48 hours, despite having a shorter plasma half-life of only 30 minutes to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>In most individuals, once-daily dosing is enough to achieve effective acid inhibition. If necessary, a second dose can be given before an evening meal.</p>\n<p>The number of H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump molecules increases after fasting and food decreases the oral bioavailability of the drug. Hence, PPIs are given around 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.</p>\n<p>PPIs <strong>cannot inhibit</strong> all gastric acid pumps with oral dosing because <strong>not all pumps are active</strong> during the short half-life of the PPI in the blood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PPIs cause maximum suppression of gastric acid. They reduce the daily production of <strong>both basal</strong> and <strong>stimulated acid secretion</strong> by 85&ndash;90%.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are available in the form of <strong>delayed-release</strong> tablets, capsules, and oral suspension packets and for immediate acid suppression, there are <strong>intravenous formulations</strong> for PPIs like lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole. Therefore, the <strong>release of the drug</strong> depends upon the drug <strong>formulation.</strong></p>",

When there is a rise in blood glucose level, insulin secreted by the pancreatic beta cells binds to its receptors on the plasma membrane of adipocytes. Upon binding of insulin to its receptor, activation of the receptor's tyrosine-kinase domain occurs. This activation starts a protein activation cascade leading to the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane.</p>\n<p>Once translocation occurs and GLUT4 is inserted into the plasma membrane, facilitated diffusion of glucose down its concentration gradient into the cell occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>GLUT-2</strong>&nbsp;is found in the&nbsp;<strong>liver, pancreatic &beta; cell, small intestine,</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;kidney.&nbsp;</strong>Its function is the rapid uptake or release of glucose.</p>\n<p><strong>GLUT-5&nbsp;</strong>is present in the&nbsp;<strong>small intestine</strong>&nbsp;and is involved in the absorption of&nbsp;<strong>fructose</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>SGLT-1&nbsp;</strong>is a sodium-dependent unidirectional transporter present in the&nbsp;<strong>small intestine</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>kidney</strong>&nbsp;that is involved in the active uptake of glucose against a concentration gradient.</p>",

This type of horizontal gene transfer may occur by two mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lytic cycle&nbsp;</strong>- In the lytic cycle, also known as the virulent cycle, a large number of progeny phages build up inside the host bacterium; eventually, the host cell ruptures, releasing the bacteriophages.

Rather, the phage DNA becomes integrated with the bacterial chromosome. This phage DNA multiplies with the host cell and is transferred to daughter cells.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option A -&nbsp;<strong>Conjugation</strong> is the method of&nbsp;gene transfer in bacteria that involves physical contact by a male or donor bacterium with a female or recipient bacterium through an extracellular protein extrusion or appendage called the <strong>sex pili.</strong> The genetic material that is transferred is usually derived from plasmids.&nbsp;The bacteria that possess the ability to form the sex pili contain the F<sup>+</sup> plasmid and are designated as F<sup>+</sup>. The F<sup>+</sup> bacteria can transfer a single strand of the F<sup>+</sup> plasmid DNA to F<sup>-</sup> bacteria via the sex pili.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C -&nbsp;<strong>Transformation</strong> is the direct uptake of naked DNA by the bacterial cell from the environment.

It is most commonly used as a part of regimens with other agents like cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and 5-FU in several malignancies including:\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breast cancer</li>\n<li>Endometrial cancer</li>\n<li>Ovarian cancer</li>\n<li>Soft-tissue sarcoma</li>\n<li>Neuroblastoma</li>\n<li>Ewing's sarcoma</li>\n<li>Rhabdomyosarcoma</li>\n<li>ALL</li>\n<li>Multiple myeloma</li>\n<li>Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cardiotoxicity</strong>\u00a0is a known side-effect of doxorubicin. Therefore, careful monitoring is required for doxorubicin. Specifically, doxorubicin requires dose adjustment during or after radiotherapy in order to prevent radiation toxicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Vincristine</strong>\u00a0is a vinca alkaloid that acts during the\u00a0<strong>M phase</strong>\u00a0of the cell cycle.
