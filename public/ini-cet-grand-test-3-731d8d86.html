Germ cell tumors can be classified as either seminomatous or nonseminomatous. Seminoma constitutes more than 50% of all testicular cancers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most patients present with testicular pain or a testicular mass. Respiratory symptoms, back pain, weight loss, or gynecomastia may indicate metastatic disease (10\u201320%). A testicular mass is considered malignant till proven otherwise. Similarly, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy in young men should be considered metastatic testicular cancer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gold standard for the excision of a primary testicular tumor is a <strong>radical inguinal orchiectomy</strong> (Option A). A partial orchiectomy via an inguinal route may be considered in certain circumstances, such as lymphomas. <strong>Chest and abdominal axial imaging are </strong>the main<strong> staging </strong>tools<strong> </strong>for testicular tumors. The spread of testicular cancer follows an extremely predictable pattern. The interaortocaval lymph node is typically the first site of metastasis for right testicular cancer, followed by the paracaval and paraaortic lymph nodes. Left-sided testicular cancer rarely crosses to the paracaval lymph nodes. Tumor markers, distant metastases, and local stages are all included in clinical TNM staging.</p>\n<p><strong>P</strong><strong>ercutaneous testicular biopsy</strong>(Option 3) is contraindicated due to the <strong>risk of seeding</strong> in the scrotal wall. An open testicular biopsy by delivery of the testicle through the inguinal canal is recommended in cases where metastatic disease to the testicle is suspected. <strong>Recurrence </strong>usually occurs within the<strong> first two years </strong>and in the<strong> retroperitoneum</strong>(Option 4).</p>",

It means to gratify an impulse by changing the end goal from a\u00a0<strong>socially objectionable</strong>\u00a0one to a\u00a0<strong>socially valued one</strong>. Sublimation of\u00a0<strong>aggressive impulses</strong>\u00a0generally takes place through\u00a0<strong>games\u00a0</strong>or<strong>\u00a0sports</strong>. Sublimation allows instincts to be channelled and not dammed up or diverted. Hence, in sublimation, feelings are acknowledged, modified, and directed toward a socially valued/acceptable goal so that modest instinctual satisfaction is achieved.</p>\n<p><strong>Mature defense mechanisms </strong>are healthy and adaptive throughout the life cycle. They are socially adaptive and useful in the integration of personal needs and motives, social demands, and interpersonal relations. They can underlie seemingly admirable and virtuous patterns of behaviour.</p>\n<p>Other mature defense mechanisms are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anticipation</li>\n<li>Humor</li>\n<li>Altruism</li>\n<li>Asceticism</li>\n<li>Suppression</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Immature</strong> <strong>defense mechanisms</strong> are usually triggered due to anxieties related to intimacy or its loss. These mechanisms are fairly common in <strong>preadolescent</strong> years and <strong>adult</strong> character disorders. Although they are regarded as <strong>socially awkward</strong> and <strong>undesirable</strong>, improvement in interpersonal relationships and personal maturity can alleviate it. Some of the immature defense mechanisms are:</p>\n<p>Option B. <strong>Introjection </strong>involves taking up features from the <strong>external world</strong> and <strong>making</strong> them a <strong>part of oneself</strong>. Introjection of a <strong>loved object</strong> involves internalizing the characteristics of the object to ensure closeness and constant presence of the object in order to reduce the anxiety associated with separation from or loss of the object. Similarly, the introjection of a <strong>feared object</strong> involves internalizing the aggressive characteristics of the object and using it defensively to have the aggression under their control. Introjection can also take place from a <strong>sense of guilt</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C. <strong>Regression</strong> involves a return to a previous stage of development or functioning to avoid the anxieties or hostilities involved in later stages. This reflects a basic tendency to achieve instinctual gratification or to escape instinctual tension by returning to earlier modes and levels of gratification when later and more differentiated modes fail or involve intolerable conflict.</p>\n<p>Option D. In <strong>somatization,</strong> psychic derivatives are converted into bodily symptoms and tend to react to somatic symptoms rather than psychic ones.</p>\n<p>Other immature defenses include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acting out</li>\n<li>Blocking</li>\n<li>Hypochondriasis</li>\n<li>Passive\u2013aggressive behaviour</li>\n<li>Projection (non-psychotic)</li>\n<li>Schizoid fantasy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Neurotic Defenses</strong> include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Controlling</li>\n<li>Displacement</li>\n<li>Exterternalization</li>\n<li>Inhibition</li>\n<li>Intellectualization</li>\n<li>Isolation</li>\n<li>Rationalization</li>\n<li>Reaction formation</li>\n<li>Repression</li>\n<li>Sexualization</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Narcissistic-Psychotic Defenses</strong> include Projection, Denial, and Distortion.</p>",

This is also associated with complaints of severe vertigo.</p>\n<p>Benign positional paroxysmal vertigo is typically thought to be caused by the dislodgement of a piece of <strong>calcium carbonate</strong> from the otoconial membrane within one of the canals.\u00a0The <strong>posterior canal</strong> is affected 90% of the time in\u00a0benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, and lateral canal pathology causes approximately 8% of cases. The classical presentation of BPPV is <strong>recurrent, brief (&lt;1 minute) episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The therapeutic maneuver is the <strong>Epley maneuver, displacing</strong><strong>\u00a0the otolith</strong> from <strong>the posterior canal.\u00a0</strong>This\u00a0ends the sensation of vertigo with positional changes relieving the symptoms. This is only a temporary cure and there is a high rate of recurrence.</p>",

It is useful in phobias, obsessions, compulsions, and some sexual disorders. It has three steps: relaxation training, hierarchy construction, and desensitization of the stimulus.</p>\n<p>Option D.<strong> Exposure and response prevention</strong>&nbsp;is a strategy within CBT that is effective in the management of OCD.

Positioning for KMC: The baby is placed between the mother's breast in an upright position. The hips are abducted and flexed in the frog position and the arms are also flexed. The <strong>abdomen of the baby</strong> should be at the <strong>level of the mother's epigastrium</strong>. In this position, the <strong>mother's breathing would stimulate the baby</strong> and <strong>prevent</strong> the development of <strong>apnea</strong>.</p>\n<p>The duration of KMC should be gradually increased. Sessions <strong>shorter than 1 hour</strong> should be <strong>avoided</strong>. Length of skin-to-skin contact can be gradually increased <strong>up to 24 hours a day</strong> with interruption only for changing diapers. KMC is not necessary once the baby attains<strong> 2500g of weight or 37 weeks of gestation</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",
