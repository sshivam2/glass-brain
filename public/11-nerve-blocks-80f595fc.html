    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Epidural blood patch The most definitive treatment for post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is the epidural blood patch. This procedure involves injecting the patient's own blood into the epidural space, which effectively seals the hole caused by the dural puncture. The blood clot forms a tamponade that prevents cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from leaking further, which alleviates the symptoms of PDPH. The success rate of this procedure is very high, with many patients experiencing immediate relief from their headache. The epidural blood patch is considered the gold standard in managing PDPH and is the most effective treatment. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Bedrest Bedrest is often recommended as part of the management for PDPH, but it is not the most definitive treatment. While lying down may help reduce the headache by decreasing the pressure difference between the intracranial space and the spinal canal, it does not address the underlying cause of the headache, which is the CSF leak. Bedrest alone is generally supportive and might help alleviate symptoms temporarily, but it does not provide a long-term solution. Option (B): Analgesics Analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen, can help manage the pain associated with PDPH, but they do not treat the root cause. They may offer some symptomatic relief, but they will not stop the CSF leak or resolve the headache permanently. Therefore, analgesics are useful in the short term, but they are not the definitive treatment for PDPH. Option (C): Abdominal binders Abdominal binders have no role in the treatment of PDPH. While they are used in other contexts, such as providing support after abdominal surgery, they do not have any therapeutic benefit in cases of PDPH. They will not address the CSF leak or reduce the headache associated with the condition. Thus, abdominal binders are not an appropriate treatment for PDPH.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Preloading with one litre of colloid The best prevention of hypotension during spinal anesthesia is preloading with colloid solutions, such as albumin or hydroxyethyl starch (HES). Colloids are particularly effective at increasing the intravascular volume and maintaining circulatory stability during spinal anesthesia. They are more effective than crystalloids in expanding blood volume because they stay within the vascular compartment longer, thereby helping to prevent hypotension caused by vasodilation and reduced venous return associated with spinal block. This preload strategy helps to counteract the negative effects of spinal anesthesia, ensuring adequate circulation and minimizing the risk of hypotension. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Preloading with 1 litre of RL Preloading with Ringer's lactate (RL), a crystalloid solution, is commonly used, but it is less effective than colloids in preventing hypotension. Crystalloids rapidly diffuse into the interstitial space, leading to a smaller increase in intravascular volume compared to colloids. While RL can be helpful in increasing circulating volume, it does not provide the same sustained effect as colloids and is not as efficient in preventing hypotension during spinal anesthesia. Option (C): Small dose of vasopressor Vasopressors, such as phenylephrine or ephedrine, can be used to treat hypotension if it occurs, but they are not a primary preventive measure. Vasopressors work by constricting blood vessels and increasing blood pressure, but they do not address the underlying cause of hypotension, which is the loss of vascular tone due to spinal anesthesia. Therefore, while they may be useful as a rescue treatment, they are not as effective in preventing hypotension as proper volume preload with colloids. Option (D): Head down position The head-down position (Trendelenburg position) was historically believed to help prevent hypotension by increasing venous return to the heart. However, this is no longer commonly recommended because it has been shown to be ineffective in preventing or treating hypotension during spinal anesthesia. In fact, it may even cause respiratory discomfort and exacerbate venous pooling in the legs. Instead, adequate fluid preload (especially with colloids) and careful monitoring of blood pressure are more effective strategies.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Touhy\u2019s The needle commonly used for epidural anesthesia is the Touhy needle. This needle has a characteristic curved shape that facilitates easier placement into the epidural space. The design of the Touhy needle, with its bevel facing upward, allows for better maneuverability and helps to reduce the risk of dural puncture. The tip of the needle is blunted, which reduces the likelihood of accidentally puncturing the dura mater, thus minimizing complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage. This makes it the preferred choice for epidural procedures. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Sprotte The Sprotte needle is often used for spinal anesthesia rather than epidural anesthesia. It has a pencil-point tip, which is designed to minimize trauma to the dura and reduce the risk of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH). While it can also be used for epidural procedures in some cases, it is primarily known for its use in spinal anesthesia due to its design, which is optimized for safely puncturing the dura without causing a large hole. Option (C): Quinkes The Quinke needle is another type of spinal needle, similar to the Sprotte needle, but it has a cutting bevel. This makes it suitable for spinal anesthesia, but it is not ideal for epidural use. The cutting bevel increases the risk of accidental dural puncture, which can lead to complications like cerebrospinal fluid leakage and post-dural puncture headache. Therefore, it is not the preferred needle for epidural anesthesia. Option (D): Greene The Greene needle is also primarily used for spinal anesthesia and is not typically used for epidural procedures. It has a design similar to the Quinke needle, with a cutting edge that facilitates piercing the dura. Like the Quinke needle, its use in epidural anesthesia is not common, as the risk of accidental dural puncture is higher with cutting needles, and these are not as suited for epidural access.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) T10 The correct answer is T10, which corresponds to the sensory level that reaches the umbilicus. The sensory dermatome for T10 lies at the level of the umbilicus, meaning that when a patient experiences loss of sensation up to the umbilicus, the spinal blockade or anesthesia has reached the T10 level. This is important in clinical practice, especially during regional anesthesia like spinal or epidural anesthesia, where the sensory block is often assessed to determine the adequacy of the anesthetic level for specific surgical procedures. Incorrect Options: Option (A): L4 L4 is a much lower level of the spinal cord and corresponds to sensation in the knee and lower leg. A sensory block at the L4 level would not cover the umbilicus area. The L4 dermatome is typically associated with sensations of the medial lower leg, including the knee, and would not be expected to cause loss of sensation up to the umbilicus. Option (B): T6 T6 is a higher level than T10 and corresponds to the area around the xiphoid process (the bottom of the sternum). Sensory loss at this level would cover the upper abdomen but would not reach the umbilicus, which is below this level. Therefore, T6 would cause a sensory block above the umbilicus, not including it. Option (C): T4 T4 is higher than T10 and corresponds to the area near the nipple line, specifically around the level of the third or fourth intercostal space. A block at this level would not reach the umbilicus, which is much lower down the abdomen. The T4 level is typically associated with sensory loss around the chest and upper abdomen.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 1.5 The correct answer is 1.5, which is the threshold below which neuraxial blocks (such as spinal or epidural anesthesia) are generally considered safe to perform in patients who are on anticoagulation therapy or have concerns about bleeding. INR (International Normalized Ratio) is a measure of blood clotting and the higher the INR, the greater the risk of bleeding. An INR value greater than 1.5 increases the risk of complications like spinal or epidural hematoma, which can cause serious neurological damage. Therefore, it is recommended that the INR be less than 1.5 before performing a neuraxial block to minimize bleeding risks. Incorrect Options: Option (A): 1.1 An INR of 1.1 is relatively low and suggests that the patient's blood clotting ability is within the normal range. While this would technically allow a neuraxial block to be performed safely, it is typically advised to have an INR slightly higher than this, such as 1.2, to account for variations in lab results and patient factors. A value of 1.1 might still be considered on the lower end of the safe range, but it\u2019s generally on the borderline for comfort in clinical practice. Option (B): 1.2 An INR of 1.2 is still within a safe range for performing a neuraxial block, but 1.5 is generally accepted as the upper safe limit for most institutions. In practice, the INR should be kept under 1.5, so while 1.2 is acceptable, it is safer and more conservative to maintain the threshold at 1.5 to avoid any potential complications from bleeding. Option (D): 1.6 An INR of 1.6 is above the recommended threshold for performing neuraxial blocks. An INR greater than 1.5 significantly increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as hematoma formation. For neuraxial anesthesia, an INR of 1.6 would generally be considered too high and would require delaying the procedure until the INR is reduced to a safer level, typically under 1.5.",

The etiology of PDPH involves a dural puncture, which is not typically associated with epidural anesthesia as it involves placing a needle into the epidural space rather than puncturing the dura. In fact, for patients with a history of PDPH from spinal anesthesia, an epidural block may sometimes be preferred as it carries a lower risk of dural puncture. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Patient refusal Patient refusal is a clear contraindication to any medical procedure, including epidural anesthesia. If a patient refuses to undergo the procedure, it is not ethically or legally permissible to proceed. Consent is a crucial component of patient care, and performing any intervention without consent can lead to legal consequences, as well as compromise patient trust and safety. Option (B): Infection at the site of injection Infection at the site of injection is an absolute contraindication to performing an epidural block. If there is an infection at or near the proposed injection site (such as a skin infection or abscess), the risk of introducing bacteria into the epidural space is significantly increased. This could result in serious complications, such as epidural abscess or meningitis, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, an infection at the site must be treated or resolved before proceeding with an epidural. Option (C): INR > 1.5 An INR greater than 1.5 is a contraindication to epidural anesthesia because it indicates an increased risk of bleeding. If the INR is elevated, there is a higher likelihood of bleeding complications, such as epidural hematoma, which can compress the spinal cord and lead to permanent neurological damage. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that the INR is within a safe range (generally less than 1.5) before performing an epidural block.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mydriasis Mydriasis (dilation of the pupil) is not a typical sign of a successful stellate ganglion block. A stellate ganglion block is performed to block sympathetic nerves and is generally expected to result in a series of signs associated with sympathetic blockade, particularly on the ipsilateral side of the body. However, mydriasis is not one of these signs. In fact, the blockage of the sympathetic fibers should result in miosis (constriction of the pupil) due to the unopposed parasympathetic activity. Mydriasis, or pupil dilation, can occur due to other factors such as certain medications or neural damage but is not an expected effect of a stellate ganglion block. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Ptosis Ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) is a common sign of a successful stellate ganglion block. The sympathetic fibers that are blocked by the stellate ganglion block supply the muscles that elevate the eyelid (the levator palpebrae muscle). Therefore, the loss of sympathetic input can cause ptosis, which is often used as an indicator of successful blockade. Option (C): Guttmann\u2019s sign Guttmann\u2019s sign refers to the warmness and redness of the skin over the affected side of the face following a stellate ganglion block. It is a characteristic sign that indicates successful blockade of the sympathetic nerves. This is because sympathetic blockade leads to vasodilation, which causes the skin to become warm and flushed. Option (D): Decreased sweating over the face Decreased sweating over the face is another typical sign of a successful stellate ganglion block. The sympathetic nerves that innervate sweat glands in the face are blocked, resulting in reduced sweating on the affected side. This is considered one of the hallmark signs of a successful block, along with the other signs such as ptosis and Guttmann's sign.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Caudal anaesthesia Caudal anaesthesia is not typically used for Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS). While caudal anaesthesia is a common technique for providing anesthesia in children and for certain lower abdominal surgeries, it is not suitable for a caesarean section in adults. This is because the caudal space is limited, and it does not provide a wide enough spread of anesthesia to cover the entire uterus and other structures involved in a cesarean delivery. For LSCS, techniques that ensure complete and more predictable sensory and motor block, such as spinal or epidural anesthesia, are preferred. Incorrect Options: Option (A): General anaesthesia General anaesthesia can be used for LSCS, especially in emergency situations or when regional anesthesia is contraindicated or not preferred. In cases where the patient is unable to undergo regional anesthesia, general anesthesia can be administered safely, though it carries risks such as airway management and aspiration. It is less commonly used compared to regional anesthesia due to its greater risk profile, but it remains a valid option for LSCS. Option (B): Spinal anaesthesia Spinal anaesthesia is a commonly used technique for LSCS. It is a single-shot technique where a local anesthetic is injected into the subarachnoid space to block sensory and motor nerves, providing excellent anesthesia for lower abdominal surgeries, including caesarean sections. The advantages of spinal anesthesia include rapid onset, complete block of the lower abdomen, and the avoidance of general anesthesia risks. It is often the preferred method for elective and planned cesarean deliveries. Option (D): Combined spinal & epidural anaesthesia Combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia (CSE) is also a viable option for LSCS. This technique combines the rapid onset and high-quality block of spinal anesthesia with the option for prolonged analgesia via the epidural space. It is particularly useful in cases where extended postoperative analgesia is required or when there's a need for more flexible anesthesia management during the surgery. CSE is commonly used in both elective and emergency cesarean sections.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above All of the above tests are used to identify the epidural space during epidural anesthesia placement. These tests provide different methods to confirm proper needle placement within the epidural space. Loss of resistance is the most commonly used technique. As the needle is advanced through the tissues, the anesthesiologist applies pressure to the syringe, and when the needle enters the epidural space, there is a sudden \"loss of resistance\" to the injection. This indicates that the needle has passed through the ligamentum flavum and is within the epidural space. Duram\u2019s sign refers to a feeling of a sudden, soft give or a distinct \"pop\" when the needle enters the dural membrane, confirming that the epidural space has been located. Westphal sign is a less commonly used sign, but it involves the observation of the patient's reflexes and muscle tone. It may indicate the presence of the epidural space as the introduction of local anesthetic may affect the motor and sensory responses. Since all these signs play a role in identifying the epidural space, the correct answer is (D) All of the above.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Postural hypotension The most common complication of a celiac plexus block is postural hypotension. This is because the celiac plexus is responsible for autonomic regulation of the abdominal organs, including blood vessels. When this plexus is blocked, it can result in a decrease in sympathetic tone, leading to vasodilation and a subsequent drop in blood pressure, particularly when the patient changes position (e.g., from lying down to standing). Postural hypotension can cause dizziness or fainting, making it the most common complication of the procedure. Incorrect Options: Option (B): Retroperitoneal hemorrhage While retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a potential risk with any procedure involving the abdominal cavity or deep structures, it is much less common with a celiac plexus block. The block is typically performed using careful imaging guidance to avoid major blood vessels, and hemorrhage is a rare complication. When it does occur, it is typically due to inadvertent puncture of a large blood vessel, but this is not as frequent as other complications like postural hypotension. Option (C): Pneumothorax Pneumothorax is also a risk, especially if the procedure is performed incorrectly or if the needle is advanced too far laterally into the chest cavity. However, this is relatively uncommon with a properly performed celiac plexus block. The procedure is generally done with imaging guidance, such as fluoroscopy or CT, which minimizes the risk of puncturing the lung and causing a pneumothorax. Option (D): Intravascular injection Intravascular injection is a risk in any regional anesthetic procedure but is less common in celiac plexus blocks when appropriate precautions are taken. The procedure involves careful needle placement to avoid large blood vessels, and while inadvertent injection into a blood vessel is possible, it is not the most frequent complication. Typically, the area being targeted is not rich in large vessels, so this complication is less likely compared to others.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pia and arachnoid In spinal anaesthesia, the local anaesthetic drug is deposited in the subarachnoid space, which lies between the pia mater and arachnoid mater. The subarachnoid space contains the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the drug is injected directly into this space to provide the anaesthetic effect. By targeting this space, the drug can diffuse around the spinal cord and nerves, blocking their transmission and providing analgesia and anesthesia. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Dura and arachnoid The dura and arachnoid are two of the layers of the meninges surrounding the spinal cord. The space between them is known as the subdural space. This is not the location where the local anaesthetic is typically injected during spinal anaesthesia. The subdural space is much smaller and not where the drug is intended to act for spinal anaesthesia. Injecting into this space can be problematic and may lead to partial or inadequate anaesthesia. Option (C): Dura and vertebra This refers to the epidural space, which is the area outside the dura mater and surrounding the spinal cord. While this space is used for epidural anaesthesia, it is not the correct location for spinal anaesthesia. Epidural anaesthesia involves injecting the local anaesthetic into the epidural space, not the subarachnoid space between the pia and arachnoid. Option (D): Into the cord substance Injecting the local anaesthetic directly into the substance of the spinal cord is dangerous and would likely cause significant damage to the spinal cord tissue. This is not a technique used in spinal anaesthesia, as the goal is to block nerve transmission without causing harm to the spinal cord itself. The anaesthetic is deposited in the space around the spinal cord, not within the cord.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 6th (Abducent nerve) The 6th cranial nerve, also known as the abducent nerve, is the most commonly affected cranial nerve in spinal anaesthesia. This nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for the lateral movement of the eye. During spinal anaesthesia, a sympathetic block can occur, which affects the tone of the extraocular muscles, particularly the lateral rectus. This can lead to diplopia (double vision) due to the unopposed action of the medial rectus muscle. The abducent nerve is especially vulnerable because it has the longest intracranial course, making it more susceptible to increased intracranial pressure changes or anaesthetic effects. Incorrect Options: Option (A): 2nd (Optic nerve) The 2nd cranial nerve, or optic nerve, is responsible for vision, and although visual disturbances can occur in some cases of spinal anaesthesia due to increased intracranial pressure or other factors, it is not the most commonly affected. The optic nerve does not usually get directly impacted by the anaesthetic block, making this option incorrect. Option (B): 3rd (Oculomotor nerve) The 3rd cranial nerve, or oculomotor nerve, controls most of the eye's movements, including constriction of the pupil and accommodation. Though it can be affected by changes in the sympathetic nervous system or intracranial pressure, the oculomotor nerve is not typically the most commonly affected in spinal anaesthesia. This option is incorrect because the abducent nerve is more likely to be impacted. Option (C): 4th (Trochlear nerve) The 4th cranial nerve, or trochlear nerve, innervates the superior oblique muscle, responsible for downward and lateral eye movement. Similar to the oculomotor nerve, while the trochlear nerve could potentially be influenced by changes in the pressure and tone of the extraocular muscles, it is not the most commonly affected in spinal anaesthesia. The abducent nerve remains the most commonly affected.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hemophilia A subarachnoid block (spinal anaesthesia) is contraindicated in hemophilia because patients with this condition have a bleeding disorder, which significantly increases the risk of bleeding or hematoma formation in the spinal cord or epidural space. This bleeding could lead to serious complications, such as spinal cord compression or paralysis. In hemophilia, the blood\u2019s ability to clot is impaired, making any procedure involving potential trauma to blood vessels (like the placement of a needle for spinal anaesthesia) potentially dangerous. Therefore, spinal anaesthesia should be avoided in these patients unless carefully managed and the risk is thoroughly evaluated. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Diabetic gangrene Diabetic gangrene refers to a severe complication of diabetes where poor circulation and high blood sugar levels can lead to tissue death. However, diabetic gangrene is not a contraindication for spinal anaesthesia. In fact, diabetic patients, while at risk for poor circulation, can typically undergo spinal anaesthesia, provided their blood sugar levels are well-managed and any associated complications (such as neuropathy) are considered. Therefore, diabetic gangrene does not preclude spinal anaesthesia. Option (B): Buerger\u2019s disease Buerger's disease is a condition that causes inflammation and clotting of blood vessels, particularly in the arms and legs. While patients with Buerger's disease may suffer from impaired circulation, it is not a contraindication to subarachnoid block. These patients can undergo spinal anaesthesia, but careful attention should be paid to vascular status and circulation. Thus, Buerger\u2019s disease, although it may pose some challenges in terms of circulation, does not outright contraindicate spinal anaesthesia. Option (C): Atherosclerotic gangrene Atherosclerotic gangrene results from severe narrowing and hardening of the arteries, leading to reduced blood flow and eventual tissue death. Like diabetic gangrene, while it poses significant challenges in circulation, atherosclerotic gangrene is not an absolute contraindication to spinal anaesthesia. The primary concern in these patients would be ensuring good blood pressure management and monitoring of cardiovascular function during the procedure, but atherosclerotic gangrene alone does not preclude spinal anaesthesia.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Thinner needle Post-spinal headache (PDPH) occurs due to leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the puncture site in the dura, which results in a reduction of CSF volume and pressure. Using a thinner needle during the spinal anaesthesia procedure reduces the likelihood of creating a large puncture hole in the dura. A thinner needle creates a smaller opening, leading to less CSF leakage and a lower risk of developing a post-spinal headache. Studies have shown that the incidence of PDPH is lower when smaller gauge needles, such as 25 or 27 gauge, are used compared to larger ones, making this an effective preventive measure. Incorrect Options: Option (B): Early ambulation Early ambulation is not effective in preventing post-spinal headaches. In fact, early ambulation may increase the risk of PDPH, as it may contribute to increased pressure changes in the spinal column and the puncture site. Post-spinal headaches are more common when patients are in an upright position too soon after the procedure, as it allows for more CSF leakage from the puncture site. It's recommended to keep patients lying flat for a few hours after the procedure to minimize this risk, making early ambulation not beneficial for preventing PDPH. Option (C): Induced hypotension Induced hypotension does not prevent post-spinal headaches and is not typically used for this purpose. In fact, hypotension can complicate spinal anaesthesia by reducing perfusion to vital organs, especially in patients with other underlying medical conditions. While maintaining adequate fluid balance and avoiding hypotension are important during spinal anaesthesia, lowering blood pressure deliberately (induced hypotension) is not a recommended strategy to prevent post-spinal headaches. Option (D): Decrease dose of local anaesthetic Decreasing the dose of local anaesthetic does not directly prevent post-spinal headaches. The incidence of PDPH is more closely related to the technique of the spinal puncture (needle size) and the position of the patient post-procedure, rather than the dose of local anaesthetic used. While adjusting the dose of local anaesthetic may impact the depth of anaesthesia or the duration of block, it does not have a significant effect on the occurrence of post-spinal headaches.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Proprioception In spinal anaesthesia, proprioception is the last type of nerve fiber affected. Proprioception refers to the ability to sense the position, movement, and balance of the body. Nerve fibers responsible for proprioception are typically located in the deep nerve fibers of the spinal cord and are among the last to be blocked during spinal anaesthesia. This is due to their larger diameter and lower sensitivity to local anaesthetics compared to other sensory fibers such as pain or temperature. These proprioceptive fibers are less vulnerable to the block, which is why they are affected last during the procedure. Incorrect Options: Option (B): Pain Pain fibers are blocked earlier than proprioceptive fibers during spinal anaesthesia. The pain fibers (specifically A-delta and C fibers) are small in diameter and highly sensitive to local anaesthetics. Because of this, pain sensation is typically lost relatively early during the block, making it one of the first sensations to be affected. So, pain fibers are blocked before proprioception, making this option incorrect. Option (C): Temperature Temperature sensation is also blocked before proprioception in spinal anaesthesia. Like pain fibers, temperature fibers are small and unmyelinated or thinly myelinated, making them more sensitive to local anaesthetics. As a result, temperature sensation is usually lost along with pain sensation, and it is affected before proprioception during spinal anaesthesia. Therefore, this option is also incorrect. Option (D): Touch Touch fibers are affected earlier than proprioceptive fibers as well. Light touch sensations are carried by small to medium-sized myelinated fibers, and these are blocked before proprioception in spinal anaesthesia. Since touch fibers are more sensitive to local anaesthetics than proprioceptive fibers, they are blocked earlier. Hence, this option is also incorrect.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hypotension The most common complication of spinal anaesthesia is hypotension. This occurs due to the sympathetic blockade induced by the local anaesthetic in the subarachnoid space. The sympathetic blockade leads to vasodilation, which reduces vascular tone and impairs the body's ability to maintain blood pressure. Additionally, venous pooling occurs, especially in the lower limbs, further decreasing venous return to the heart. As a result, there is a decrease in cardiac output, leading to hypotension. Hypotension is a frequent and expected side effect in spinal anaesthesia, but it can be managed with intravenous fluids and vasopressors if necessary. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Post spinal headache While post-spinal headache is a known complication of spinal anaesthesia, it is less common than hypotension. The headache is typically caused by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage due to a dural puncture during the procedure. This complication occurs due to the loss of CSF volume, leading to a drop in intracranial pressure, and it manifests as a headache, especially when the patient is in an upright position. However, it is not the most common complication, making this option incorrect. Option (B): Arrhythmias Arrhythmias are uncommon complications of spinal anaesthesia. Though spinal anaesthesia can sometimes cause changes in heart rate and rhythm, such as bradycardia, arrhythmias are generally rare. The sympathetic blockade caused by spinal anaesthesia can lead to vagal stimulation, causing bradycardia, but more severe arrhythmias are rare compared to hypotension. Therefore, this is not the most common complication. Option (D): Meningitis Meningitis is a serious but rare complication of spinal anaesthesia. It occurs when an infection affects the meninges (the protective layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord) after the procedure. The risk of meningitis is low, particularly with proper sterile technique during the procedure. While meningitis is a critical complication, it is not the most common. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Brachial plexus block Pneumothorax is a potential complication of a brachial plexus block when performed via the interscalene approach. The brachial plexus is located near the lung apex, and during the procedure, the needle can accidentally puncture the pleura, leading to a pneumothorax. This complication is more common in the interscalene approach because of the proximity of the lung and the pleura to the targeted nerve roots. Pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space, leading to collapse of the lung. It is essential for the provider to be aware of this risk, monitor the patient for signs of pneumothorax, and act quickly if it occurs. Incorrect Options: Option (B): Epidural block A pneumothorax is not a common complication of epidural block. Epidural blocks are performed in the epidural space, which is outside the dura mater and typically well away from the lungs and pleura. While there are risks associated with epidural anesthesia, such as dural puncture and intravascular injection, pneumothorax is not typically one of them. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option (C): Axillary block Pneumothorax is also not a common complication of an axillary block. The axillary approach to brachial plexus block involves injection around the brachial plexus in the axilla (armpit area). The lung and pleura are far from this site, making pneumothorax very unlikely. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option (D): High spinal block A high spinal block primarily involves the upper levels of the spinal cord (such as the cervical or thoracic segments). While a high spinal block can lead to significant complications like respiratory depression or hypotension due to sympathetic blockade, pneumothorax is not one of the complications associated with it. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lateral to subclavian artery For a brachial plexus block, the needle is typically inserted lateral to the subclavian artery when performing the interscalene approach. This technique targets the brachial plexus at the level of the cervical roots, just as they emerge from the scalene muscles. The subclavian artery lies medially to the plexus, so the needle is inserted laterally to avoid direct injury to the artery and to achieve a safe and effective block of the nerve roots. This is the most common and preferred approach for performing a brachial plexus block. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Medial to subclavian artery Inserting the needle medial to the subclavian artery is not correct for brachial plexus block, as this would increase the risk of damaging the subclavian artery or other vascular structures. The goal is to avoid structures like the artery by inserting the needle laterally, which is safer and more effective. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option (C): Medial to subclavian vein The brachial plexus block is performed near the subclavian artery, not the subclavian vein, in most approaches. The subclavian vein is typically positioned more medially compared to the subclavian artery, and the plexus lies lateral to the artery and vein. The needle is inserted laterally, not medially, to the vein. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option (D): Lateral to subclavian vein The needle is not typically inserted lateral to the subclavian vein for a brachial plexus block. The main target is the brachial plexus, and the preferred approach places the needle laterally to the subclavian artery. Inserting the needle laterally to the vein could lead to complications or poor access to the desired anatomical structures, so this option is also incorrect.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fluid (spinal) is alternately withdrawn and reinjected under pressure Barbotage is a technique used in spinal anesthesia where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is alternately withdrawn and reinjected under pressure to test for or improve the spread of the local anesthetic agent. This procedure is primarily used to adjust the spread and ensure a consistent distribution of the anesthetic in the subarachnoid space. By removing and reintroducing fluid, the anesthetist can assess the pressure and distribution of the local anesthetic, thereby optimizing the block and reducing complications. Incorrect Options: Option (B): Technique used Epidural Analgesia This option is incorrect because Barbotage is not used for epidural analgesia. Instead, it is a technique used in spinal anesthesia, specifically for adjusting the spread of local anesthetics within the subarachnoid space. Epidural analgesia involves the injection of anesthetic agents into the epidural space, not the subarachnoid space, and does not typically require the barbotage technique. Option (C): Technique popularized in caudal Analgesia This option is also incorrect. Barbotage is not particularly associated with caudal analgesia. While caudal analgesia involves the injection of anesthetic agents into the caudal epidural space, barbotage is more commonly used in spinal anesthesia to adjust the spread of local anesthetics within the subarachnoid space. The technique is not primarily used in caudal analgesia, making this option incorrect. Option (D): Cannot be carried out under hypothermic condition This statement is incorrect because Barbotage can still be carried out under hypothermic conditions, although there might be some effect on the efficiency or ease of the procedure. Hypothermia might slow down the spread of the anesthetic or affect the fluid dynamics, but the technique itself is not contraindicated in hypothermic conditions. Therefore, this option is incorrect. In conclusion, Barbotage involves alternately withdrawing and reinjecting spinal fluid under pressure, which helps assess and optimize the spread of local anesthetics during spinal anesthesia. It is not used in epidural analgesia, caudal analgesia, and is not specifically contraindicated under hypothermic conditions.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypotension bradycardia High spinal anesthesia occurs when the local anesthetic spreads too high in the subarachnoid space, affecting the upper spinal segments (typically above T4-T6). This can lead to sympathetic block and a loss of sympathetic tone, resulting in hypotension (due to vasodilation and decreased cardiac output) and bradycardia (due to parasympathetic dominance from the vagus nerve). This combination of low blood pressure and low heart rate is characteristic of high spinal anesthesia. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Hypertension tachycardia This option is incorrect. Hypertension and tachycardia are not typical of high spinal anesthesia. In fact, the loss of sympathetic tone and the increase in parasympathetic activity lead to hypotension and bradycardia rather than an increase in heart rate or blood pressure. These symptoms are more commonly seen in low spinal anesthesia or epidural anesthesia. Option (B): Hypertension bradycardia This is also incorrect. While bradycardia is a common feature of high spinal anesthesia, hypertension is not. Hypotension is more commonly seen due to the sympathetic blockade and resulting vasodilation, leading to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Hypertension would suggest a different etiology, such as local anesthetic toxicity or other conditions unrelated to high spinal anesthesia. Option (C): Hypotension tachycardia This option is incorrect because tachycardia is not typically seen in high spinal anesthesia. The parasympathetic dominance following a high spinal block leads to bradycardia rather than tachycardia. Hypotension is indeed a key feature, but tachycardia is not usually present due to the reflex inhibition of sympathetic nervous activity.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IV regional block A Bier block, also known as intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA), is a technique used for procedures on the extremities. The local anesthetic is injected into a vein after the limb is isolated by a tourniquet to prevent the anesthetic from entering the systemic circulation. This method provides effective anesthesia to the distal portion of the limb, allowing pain-free surgery for conditions like fractures or soft tissue procedures. It is particularly useful for surgeries that are short duration and for patients where general anesthesia may not be appropriate. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Subarachnoid block This is incorrect. A subarachnoid block, also known as a spinal anesthesia, is a technique in which a local anesthetic is injected into the subarachnoid space (the area surrounding the spinal cord) to achieve complete anesthesia below the injection site. This differs from Bier block, which is focused on regional anesthesia for the limbs, not the spinal cord. Option (C): Extradural block This is incorrect. An extradural block, also known as epidural anesthesia, involves the administration of local anesthetics into the epidural space surrounding the spinal cord. While both epidural block and Bier block are regional techniques, they are distinct, with epidural blocks affecting the spinal cord and Bier block being specific to the extremities. Option (D): Local anaesthesia This option is incorrect in the context of the question. While Bier block uses local anesthetics, it specifically refers to an IV regional block rather than a simple local anesthetic application, which would be used for more superficial, targeted areas of the body (e.g., for small incisions or minor procedures).",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Drug has entered the subarachnoid space In the scenario described, the most likely cause of the patient's hypotension and respiratory depression following epidural anesthesia is that the drug accidentally entered the subarachnoid space. Epidural anesthesia is intended to affect the epidural space, but if the needle tip punctures the dura mater or if there is an inadvertent dural puncture, the local anesthetic can enter the subarachnoid space. This results in a spinal block, which can affect the sympathetic nerves, leading to hypotension and potentially respiratory depression due to the effect on the diaphragm or intercostal muscles. This type of complication is more common when large volumes or concentrations of anesthetic are used. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Allergy to drug administered This is incorrect. While drug allergies can cause symptoms like rash, pruritus, or anaphylaxis, hypotension and respiratory depression are not typical signs of an allergic reaction to local anesthetics. These symptoms are more indicative of a toxicity or spinal block resulting from an inadvertent dural puncture. Option (B): Systemic toxicity to drug administered This option is also unlikely to be the cause. Systemic toxicity of lignocaine would typically cause CNS symptoms (such as tinnitus, seizures, or perioral numbness) before any signs of hypotension or respiratory depression. Given that these symptoms occurred within 3 minutes of administration, the onset is more likely due to the local anesthetic entering the subarachnoid space rather than systemic absorption leading to toxicity. Option (C): Patient got vasovagal shock This option is incorrect. A vasovagal shock would generally result in a sudden drop in blood pressure due to a vagal response (e.g., from anxiety or pain), but it is unlikely to cause respiratory depression. Furthermore, vasovagal reactions are typically less likely to occur this quickly after epidural anesthesia administration.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sensory, autonomic, and motor nerves Spinal anesthesia, also known as subarachnoid block, typically affects sensory, autonomic, and motor nerves. When the anesthetic is injected into the subarachnoid space, it spreads and affects nerve fibers at the level where the block is administered. Sensory nerves: These fibers are responsible for transmitting sensations like pain, temperature, and touch. The sensory block typically occurs at the dermatomal level corresponding to the site of the injection. Autonomic nerves: These fibers are responsible for vasodilation and control of the heart rate. Anesthesia of these nerves can lead to hypotension due to vasodilation and sometimes bradycardia due to the blockage of sympathetic nerve fibers. Motor nerves: These fibers control voluntary muscle movement. In spinal anesthesia, motor nerve function may be affected, leading to muscle weakness or paralysis below the level of the block, depending on the extent of the spread of the anesthetic. This combination of effects is why spinal anesthesia is effective in both pain management and paralysis for surgical procedures below the injection level. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Motor and sensory nerve only This is incorrect because spinal anesthesia also affects the autonomic nerves, which are crucial for maintaining blood pressure and heart rate. Autonomic block can result in hypotension and other systemic effects, so this answer is incomplete. Option (B): Sensory and autonomic nerve only This option is also incorrect because it excludes motor nerves. Spinal anesthesia affects motor nerves as well, which is why patients can experience muscle weakness or paralysis below the level of the block. This is a key effect of spinal anesthesia and should be included in the answer. Option (C): Sensory nerves only This is incorrect as well because spinal anesthesia does not only block sensory nerves. It also affects autonomic and motor nerves, leading to the broader effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle function that are characteristic of the block.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Increased cerebral blood flow A stellate ganglion block (SGB) primarily affects the sympathetic nervous system, specifically the cervical sympathetic chain. The block typically involves the stellate ganglion, which is formed by the fusion of the inferior cervical ganglion and the first thoracic ganglion. This block can have various systemic effects, particularly through the inhibition of sympathetic tone, leading to an increase in cerebral blood flow. The increase in cerebral blood flow is thought to occur due to sympathetic blockade, which leads to vasodilation and the subsequent reduction of vascular resistance in the brain. This can be used therapeutically in certain conditions like cerebral ischemia or other cerebrovascular disorders. The sympathetic nervous system normally regulates cerebral vascular tone, and by inhibiting its effects, blood flow to the brain is enhanced. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Pupil dilatation This is incorrect because pupil dilatation (mydriasis) is a sympathetic effect, and the stellate ganglion block is intended to block sympathetic activity. While some degree of pupil changes can occur in some individuals as a side effect of the block, miosis (constriction of the pupil) is more commonly seen due to loss of sympathetic tone, rather than dilatation. Option (B): Exophthalmos This is incorrect because exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball) is typically associated with conditions like Graves' disease or thyroid dysfunction and not as a result of a stellate ganglion block. The block can, however, lead to changes in eye position or ptosis (drooping eyelid) due to sympathetic inhibition, but exophthalmos is not a direct consequence. Option (C): Anesthesia of superior glottic part of larynx This is incorrect. A stellate ganglion block does not typically result in anesthesia of the superior glottic area of the larynx. The block primarily affects the sympathetic nervous system, leading to changes in blood flow and other effects like vasodilation and reduced sweating on the affected side. Anesthesia of the laryngeal structures would require specific nerve blocks (like laryngeal nerve blocks) targeting sensory innervation to the glottis, rather than the sympathetic structures involved in the stellate ganglion block.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 1:200000 The correct concentration of epinephrine used in an epidural test dose is typically 1:200,000. The purpose of adding epinephrine to the test dose is to help identify accidental intravenous injection of the local anesthetic. If the needle tip accidentally enters a blood vessel, epinephrine will cause tachycardia and possibly hypertension, signaling the clinician to withdraw and reposition the needle or catheter. The 1:200,000 concentration is ideal because it is low enough to avoid causing significant cardiovascular side effects in the patient, but it is still potent enough to produce noticeable effects if the drug enters the bloodstream. Incorrect Options: Option (A): 1:1000 This concentration is much too strong for use in an epidural test dose. A concentration of 1:1000 would lead to more pronounced cardiovascular responses (such as tachycardia or hypertension), which could be problematic during the test dose phase. It is typically used for emergency situations like an anaphylactic reaction, not for epidural test doses. Option (B): 1:10000 A concentration of 1:10,000 is still too strong for an epidural test dose. This concentration is used for other purposes, such as in cardiac arrest situations or severe allergic reactions, where a stronger dose is necessary. In the epidural context, it would be too likely to cause pronounced systemic effects and might be uncomfortable or potentially harmful to the patient. Option (C): 1:100000 While 1:100,000 epinephrine is a commonly used concentration in other clinical settings (such as for local infiltration anesthesia), it is still higher than the 1:200,000 concentration typically used for epidural test doses. A lower concentration of epinephrine is preferred for epidural test doses to minimize side effects while still ensuring that the test is effective in detecting intravenous injection.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Musculocutaneous nerve is spared in axillary block The musculocutaneous nerve is typically spared in an axillary block because it often arises from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus and passes outside the typical distribution area of the block. During the axillary block, the local anesthetic is injected around the median, ulnar, radial, and axillary nerves, but the musculocutaneous nerve can be missed if not specifically targeted. As a result, some motor function or sensation in the lateral forearm might still be present. Incorrect Options: Option (B): Pneumothorax most commonly occurs with interscalene block This statement is incorrect because while pneumothorax is a possible complication of an interscalene block, it is not the most common one. The risk of pneumothorax is higher with supraclavicular blocks because the needle is closer to the apex of the lung. The interscalene block primarily targets the brachial plexus at the level of the cervical roots, and although it can cause diaphragmatic paralysis, the risk of pneumothorax is generally lower compared to supraclavicular blocks. Option (C): In supraclavicular block, the needle is inserted just medial to the subclavian artery This statement is incorrect because in a supraclavicular block, the needle is actually inserted just lateral to the subclavian artery, not medial. The goal of the supraclavicular block is to inject local anesthetic near the brachial plexus trunks as they pass through the scalene muscles and before they divide into the divisions. Insertion of the needle lateral to the artery helps to avoid damage to nearby structures while targeting the nerve roots effectively. Option (D): Transarterial route is used for infraclavicular block This statement is incorrect because the infraclavicular block is typically performed using a non-arterial route. The needle is inserted below the clavicle and directed towards the brachial plexus located near the subclavian artery, but it does not require the needle to pass through the artery. The goal is to block the cords of the brachial plexus, which are located lateral to the subclavian artery. The transarterial route is not typically employed here, as it could pose a higher risk for complications.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Prolonged complicated surgery A prolonged complicated surgery is not an absolute contraindication to neuraxial block (spinal or epidural anesthesia). While long procedures can increase the risk of complications such as hypotension, the use of neuraxial block in prolonged surgeries is sometimes preferred for its advantages, including better pain control and avoidance of general anesthesia. In these cases, proper dosing, monitoring, and sometimes the use of continuous epidural infusions can ensure the effectiveness and safety of the block for long surgeries. The key concern is patient condition and the choice of anesthetic technique based on clinical needs, rather than the duration of the surgery. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Patient refusal Patient refusal is an absolute contraindication to neuraxial block. If a patient does not consent to the procedure, it cannot be performed, regardless of the potential benefits or medical indications. Informed consent is a fundamental ethical and legal requirement for performing any medical procedure, including neuraxial anesthesia. Option (B): Infection at the local site An infection at the local site (such as an abscess or cellulitis) is also an absolute contraindication to performing a neuraxial block. Inserting a needle through infected skin can introduce bacteria into the epidural or spinal space, leading to serious infections such as meningitis or epidural abscess. Therefore, any signs of infection at the insertion site must be addressed before proceeding with a neuraxial block. Option (D): Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) Raised ICP is an absolute contraindication to neuraxial block, especially spinal anesthesia. This is because the block can lead to a drop in venous return from the brain, which may exacerbate the increased ICP and lead to life-threatening complications, such as herniation. Therefore, in patients with elevated ICP, alternative anesthetic techniques should be considered.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Haemorrhoid surgery In hemorrhoid surgery, the patient is commonly positioned in the sitting position for spinal anesthesia, as it allows for better access to the rectal area. The sitting position is preferred for procedures that involve the lower abdomen or perineum because it helps facilitate the correct positioning of the anesthetic in the spinal space and ensures that the anesthesia is effective for the surgery. After administering the spinal block in the sitting position, patients are typically kept in the same position for a short time, around 10 minutes or so, to allow the anesthetic to adequately spread in the spinal column before the patient is repositioned for the procedure itself. Incorrect Options: Option (A): Femoral hernia repair For femoral hernia repair, a supine position is typically used rather than a sitting position. While spinal anesthesia is still commonly used for hernia repair, the sitting position is not typically chosen for this procedure because the surgical site is more accessible when the patient is lying down, and this facilitates better positioning and surgical access. Option (C): LSCS (Lower Segment Caesarean Section) For LSCS, spinal anesthesia is also commonly used, but the patient is typically positioned supine with a slight left lateral tilt (to relieve pressure from the inferior vena cava). Keeping the patient in the sitting position for a prolonged time before the surgery is not ideal, as it could increase the risk of hypotension due to the effects of anesthesia. Thus, a sitting position for an extended period is not typically used in preparation for an LSCS. Option (D): Appendectomy For appendectomy, the supine position is used, with the patient lying flat on their back. Spinal anesthesia can be administered, but the sitting position is not preferred as it does not provide optimal surgical access to the lower abdomen, where the appendix is located. The supine position is far more common and practical for appendectomies.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Infection overlying the site of injection An infection overlying the site of injection is an absolute contraindication to performing a paravertebral block or any regional anesthesia technique. Introducing a needle through an infected area can spread the infection to deeper tissues, leading to serious complications such as abscess formation or systemic sepsis. In this patient, the erythematous changes around the incision suggest a localized infection, which makes the paravertebral block unsafe. Incorrect Options: A. Raised leucocyte count A raised leucocyte count is not an absolute contraindication to a paravertebral block. While it may indicate an infection or inflammation, the block can still be safely performed as long as there is no infection at the injection site or systemic infection that contraindicates regional anesthesia. C. Current use of anticoagulation Anticoagulation is an absolute contraindication for neuraxial techniques (e.g., epidural or spinal blocks) due to the risk of epidural hematoma. However, a paravertebral block is a peripheral nerve block, and while anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding, it is considered a relative contraindication rather than an absolute one. Careful risk assessment and adherence to guidelines can make the block feasible in anticoagulated patients. D. Prior nerve injury of the area to be anesthetized A prior nerve injury is not an absolute contraindication to performing a paravertebral block. Although the presence of pre-existing nerve damage may complicate assessment of the block\u2019s success and increase the risk of neurological complications, it is generally considered a relative contraindication rather than an absolute one.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Surgery involving the cornea, anterior chamber, and lens can be performed with a retrobulbar or peribulbar block. Retrobulbar Block Retrobulbar block involves depositing local anesthetic inside the muscle cone. It aims to block the ciliary nerves, the ciliary ganglion, and cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. A retrobulbar block is deeper and uses less volume than a peribulbar block. A retrobulbar block does not anesthetize cranial nerve VII (facial nerve), which leaves the patient able to close the eye with the orbicularis oculi (CN VII) but not open it with the levator muscle (CN III). Complications of retrobulbar blocks 1. Allergic reactions \u2013 usually occur with ester-type local anesthetics 2. Retrobulbar hemorrhage \u2013 This is the most common complication seen. It is characterized by a motor block, closing of the upper lid, and simultaneous sudden rise in intraocular pressure causing proptosis. Retrobulbar hemorrhage can lead to central retinal artery occlusion and stimulation of the oculocardiac reflex. 3. Central retinal artery occlusion 4. Subconjunctival edema (chemosis) 5. Penetration or perforation (through one side and out the other) of the globe 6. Central spread of local anesthetic \u2013 due to either direct injection into the dural cuff near the optic nerve or retrograde arterial spread. Symptoms include drowsiness, vomiting, contralateral blindness, convulsions, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest within 5 minutes of injection. 7. Oculocardiac reflex \u2013 bradycardia which can follow traction on the eye. Retrobulbar or peribulbar block ablates the oculocardiac reflex by blocking the afferent pathway (ciliary ganglion to ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve), but this reflex can occur with block placement. It can also occur several hours later if it is secondary to an expanding hemorrhage. Therefore, patients with hemorrhage should be closely monitored.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Axillary approach to brachial plexus block \u2022 The axillary approach is most commonly used because it is relatively easy and has few side-effects. \u2022 It is suitable for surgery to the forearm, wrist and hand, though the radial side( antero lateral) of the forearm is sometimes missed. \u2022 This can be addressed by blocking the musculocutaneous nerve separately by injecting local anaesthetic in the belly of the coracobrachialis muscle, just superior to the pulsation of the axillary artery and at 90\u00b0 to the skin. \u2022 Because the injection is made at the level of the terminal branches, the missed segment(s) show a nerve territory distribution and not a dermatomal pattern, as is the case when the injection is placed at the level of the roots \u2022 Axillary approach is easiest as there is no risk of pneumothorax and phrenic nerve palsy due to distal injection. \u2022 The relative arrangement of 3 terminal nerves (radial , median and ulnar nerve) to axillary artery is fairly constant in axilla.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/8(12).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Traumatic rib fractures are common, resulting from significant forces impacting on the chest, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Respiratory complications, including pneumonia, are common occurring in up to 31% of patients. This morbidity and mortality associated with rib fractures is caused by three main problems: hypoventilation due to pain, impaired gas exchange in damaged lung underlying the fractures, and altered breathing mechanics. Pain associated with rib movement reduces the tidal volume and predisposes to significant atelectasis. This can further lead to retention of pulmonary secretions and pneumonia. Prompt multi-modal analgesia incorporating regional analgesia, i.v. opioids, and oral adjuncts are essential to reduce complications. Operative fixation is indicated in some instances. Analgesia for rib fractures The associated pain is notoriously difficult to manage, but effective analgesia started promptly prevents hypoventilation, enables deep breathing, adequate coughing with clearance of pulmonary secretions, and compliance with chest physiotherapy. Overall, this reduces secondary pulmonary complications, including atelectasis, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and the need for respiratory support. Step 1: simple analgesics example, paracetamol, a weak opioid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (if not contraindicated), and a strong opioid for breakthrough pain. Step 2: opioids If the pain is not controlled with the interventions in Step 1, then i.v. morphine can be titrated to effect with slow boluses of up to 0.1\u20130.2 mg kg?1 Step 3: i.v. patient-controlled analgesia If the pain remains uncontrolled, or multiple morphine boluses are required, then a morphine i.v. patient-controlled analgesia should be started, providing the patient can successfully operate one Step 4: regional anaesthetic techniques and operative fixation Thoracic epidural: Epidural analgesia has become the standard of care when opioid analgesia is inadequate or initial presentation requires it, Paravertebral block Interpleural block Intercostal block: The risk of local anaesthetic toxicity increases with every injection due to its rapid absorption.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) involves the resection of benign hypertrophic prostatic tissue by means of a movable electrocautery cutting wire loop located at the end of a urethroscope Sub-arachnoid block is the method of choice as: 1. Little anesthetic is required. 2. Patient remains awake and mentation can be assessed regularly. 3. Physiologic disturbance is minimal. 4. Respiration is affected to the minimum. 5. Early recognition of complications (Level to be restricted to T 10). 6. Peripheral vasodilatation helps reduce circulatory overload. 7. Morbidity and mortality is low. Complications can be categorized according to the time of occurrence. Intraoperative complications: \u2022 TURP syndrome. \u2022 Hypothermia: this is due to use of cold irrigation fluids. \u2022 Myocardial infarction: the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction ranges from 1\u20133%. \u2022 Bleeding and bladder perforation are also common occurrences during TURP. Postoperative complications: \u2022 TURP syndrome. \u2022 Clot Retention. \u2022 Bleeding. \u2022 Postoperative cognitive dysfunction. TURP syndrome \u2022 The primary concern associated specifically with TURP is intravascular absorption of large volumes of irrigating fluid during the procedure. The absorption occurs predominantly through exposed venous sinuses of the surgical capsule. \u2022 For the patient undergoing TURP under regional anesthesia (subarachnoid block or epidural block), the first sign has been described classically as restlessness and mental confusion. \u2022 However, presentation is variable, and the syndrome may manifest initially with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, unresponsiveness, or transient visual changes. \u2022 Hemodynamic instability (hypertension, hypotension, heart rate changes, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, or cyanosis) may be the first indication of a development of TURP syndrome Perforation: This can be: \u2013\u2013 Urethral \u2013\u2013 Intra-peritoneal (rupture of dome) \u2013\u2013 Extra-peritoneal (rupture at neck) \u2013\u2013 Capsular or peri-prostatic extravasation. Causes: It may be due to Instrumentation or over-distension of bladder. Signs and symptoms are: \u2022 Abdominal distension. \u2022 Patient may complain of abdominal pain which may be generalized, suprapubic or radiating to the shoulder. \u2022 In case of spinal anaesthesia (SA) (level < T 10) capsular tear will cause supra-pubic pain. \u2022 Rigidity. \u2022 Autonomic signs, such as pallor, nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis. \u2022 Bradycardia, hypertension, and shock like picture with large extravasation. \u2022 Non-return of irrigating fluid.",
