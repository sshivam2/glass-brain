The heavy chains in\u00a0<strong>IgM</strong>\u00a0and <strong>IgD\u00a0</strong>are <strong>mu </strong>(\u03bc) and\u00a0<strong>delta </strong>(\u03b4), respectively.\u00a0The <strong>mu </strong>and <strong>delta genes</strong> for these heavy chains are located <strong>proximal to the VDJ</strong> encoding regions\u00a0(i.e., <strong>variable, diversity,</strong> and <strong>joining regions)</strong> of the heavy chain locus. A <strong>primary RNA transcript</strong> of this entire region is produced, which then undergoes alternative RNA processing, enabling the production of both transmembrane IgM and IgD on B cells.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Options A and C:<strong> Somatic hypermutation</strong>\u00a0is a cellular response by which the immune system adapts to the new foreign elements that confront it. They do so by adding nucleotides in V gene regions of heavy and light chains, resulting in a<strong> better fit</strong> of antigen with the antibodies. This hence <strong>increases</strong> the <strong>affinity</strong> of antibodies to antigens. Due to this, the subset of plasma cells with these improved hypervariable regions are more strongly selected by the antigen and therefore constitute a larger part of the population of antibody-producing cells. This process is called <strong>affinity maturation.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D:<strong> Allelic exclusion</strong> is the process by which a cell <strong>expresses one </strong>of the<strong> two alleles</strong> of the gene and excludes the other allele.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>B cells </strong>are <strong>diploid</strong>, therefore, each B cell has <strong>six gene segment pools </strong>related to antibody chains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Two heavy-chain pools </strong>(one from each parent) and</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Four light-chain pools </strong>(one \u03ba and one \u03bb from each parent).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, <strong>each B cell uses</strong> <strong>only two</strong> of the six <strong>gene segment pools</strong>: one out of the two heavy-chain pools (maternal and paternal) and one out of the four light-chain pools. Thus, each B cell must choose not only between its \u03ba and \u03bb light-chain pools but also between its maternal and paternal light-chain and heavy-chain pools. This process of choosing is by <strong>allelic exclusion.</strong></p>",

    "solution": "<p>Rupture of the&nbsp;<strong>penile urethra</strong> causes extravasation of blood into the <strong>superficial perineal pouch, scrotum, penis,</strong> and then up to the <strong>lower anterior abdominal wall.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>superficial perineal pouch</strong> is a compartment of the perineum <strong>enclosed</strong> by the membranous layer of the perineal fascia that surrounds the <strong>scrotum</strong> or <strong>labia</strong> and <strong>penis</strong> or <strong>clitoris.</strong></p>\n<p>Anteriorly, the membranous layer of perineal fascia is continuous over the pubic symphysis and pubic bones. It is later <strong>continuous</strong> with the membranous layer of the <strong>anterior abdominal wall.</strong>&nbsp; Thus, the <strong>fluid</strong> that <strong>accumulates</strong> in the perineal pouch extends to the <strong>lower anterior abdomen.</strong></p>\n<p>In the lower lateral abdominal wall, the abdominal fascia is attached to the deep fascia of the thigh, inferior to the inguinal ligament. Thus, on trauma at the penile urethra, urine <strong>does not extravasate</strong> into the <strong>anterior thigh.</strong></p>\n<p>The superficial perineal pouch is closed posteriorly by attaching the membranous layer of superficial fascia to the posterior margin of the urogenital diaphragm. Thus, commonly there&nbsp;is <strong>no extravasation</strong> into the <strong>deep perineal pouch</strong> and the <strong>ischiorectal fossa.<br /></strong></p>\n<p>Also, the membranous layer of superficial fascia attaches to the ischiopubic rami and forms the lateral borders of the urogenital triangle. Thus, the urine <strong>does not extravasate</strong> to the <strong>thigh.</strong></p>\n<p>But, the ischiorectal fossa would be a better answer because of the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bulbourethral glands</strong> that lie in the deep perineal space open their ducts into the<strong> spongy urethra, </strong>which is related to the superficial perineal space. Also, the muscles surrounding these glands were recently found to be a continuation of the deep transverse perinei and tail of the external urethral sphincter, both of which are components of the deep perineal space. Injury to the penile urethra can damage bulbourethral glands' ducts, which can lead to damage to the above-mentioned structures and may cause extravasation of urine into the deep perineal space.&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Previously, the <strong>perineal membrane</strong> was thought to be a triangular membrane. However, recent studies show that it is contiguous anteriorly with the structures that <strong>support the urethra</strong>. Posteriorly, it is related to the support of the perineal body and lateral vaginal wall. So damage to the urethra might damage the anterior part of the perineal membrane which can make way for extravasation of blood into the deep perineal space.&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Deep perineal pouch: It was believed initially that the urogenital diaphragm was formed by 3 layers: An inferior fascia (also called the perineal membrane), deep perineal space, and a superior fascia. The superior fascia formed the inferior border of the ischioanal fossa. The Colles fascia also separates the perineal membrane from the ischioanal fossa. So, extravasation of blood into the deep perineal space is possible but extravasation into the ischioanal fossa due to penile urethral injury is highly unlikely. Recent studies have shown that this might be a slightly more complex structure.</li>\n</ol>",

However, in phase 4, <strong>higher doses</strong> of Ach (like 5 mg) act via the <strong>nicotinic receptor</strong>, shooting up the blood pressure. This phenomenon is called the reversal of Ach in blood pressure and was studied by Dale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Nicotinic receptors</strong> are <strong>ligand-gated</strong> ion channels. It can be divided into two groups: muscle receptors (N<sub>M</sub>), which are found at the skeletal neuromuscular junction, and <strong>neuronal receptors</strong> (N<sub>N</sub>), which are found in the ganglia and CNS. When stimulated at higher doses, Ach acts on N<sub>N</sub>&nbsp;receptors, leading to the stimulation of <strong>sympathetic ganglia</strong> and <strong>adrenal medulla</strong>. This&nbsp;<strong>increases</strong> the heart rate, <strong>blood pressure</strong>, and myocardial contractility.</p>\n<p><strong>Muscarinic</strong> receptors are <strong>G-coupled protein</strong> receptors involved in the parasympathetic nervous system.&nbsp;M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 are the receptor subtypes. They act via Gi or Gq subunits. When <strong>Ach</strong> is administered, it acts on&nbsp;muscarinic receptors, primarily the<strong> M3 receptors</strong>, which are located on <strong>vascular endothelial cells</strong>. It stimulates <strong>guanylyl cyclase</strong> and promotes relaxation via a cyclic GMP&ndash;dependent mechanism. At higher doses, it acts on&nbsp;<strong>M2 receptors,</strong> which have direct effects on the <strong>heart</strong>. It also inhibits the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals and decreases cyclic AMP levels.</p>",

The former presents with hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and psychomotor retardation. Type B is associated with hepatosplenomegaly and mild pulmonary involvement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option-C - <strong>Hunter disease</strong> is an X-linked inherited disorder due to a deficiency of the enzyme<strong> iduronate sulfatase</strong>. It leads to the accumulation of dermatan and heparan sulfate. Clinical features involve coarse facies, cardiovascular involvement, and distinctive skin lesions.</p>\n<p>Option-D - <strong>Hurler/Scheie disease</strong> is a mucopolysaccharidosis that has childhood and adult onset.

These sounds then <strong>travel</strong> in the reverse direction from the <strong>outer hair</strong> &mdash; basilar membrane and perilymph of <strong>cochlea</strong>&mdash; oval window &mdash; ossicles and tympanic membrane (<strong>m</strong><strong>iddle ear</strong>) &mdash; ear canal (<strong>external ear</strong>).</p>\n<p>Hence in the absence of OAE, pathologies of the middle and external ear should be ruled out before making a definitive diagnosis of cochlear pathology.</p>\n<p><strong>Tympanometry </strong>is an <strong>objective test</strong> that can be performed in patients with absent OAE to <strong>rule out</strong> any <strong>middle ear pathologies</strong>. <strong>Speech audiometry </strong>is a <strong>subjective test</strong>&nbsp;that can be performed in these patients to confirm if the hearing loss is due to <strong>cochlear</strong> or retro cochlear<strong>&nbsp;pathology</strong> (neural hearing loss).</p>\n<p><strong>Impedance Audiometry</strong> also known as <strong>Tympanometry</strong> is an objective test that is based on the principle that when the sound strikes the tympanic membrane, certain amount of sound is absorbed, while the rest is reflected So a stiffer tympano-ossicular system would reflect greater sound than a compliant one. By marking the compliance of tympano-ossicular system against various pressure changes, different types of <strong>tympanograms</strong> are obtained which are <strong>diagnostic</strong> of various <strong>middle ear pathologies</strong>.</p>\n<p>In <strong>speech audiometry</strong>, the patient&rsquo;s ability to hear and understand speech is measured. The speech reception threshold (SRT) is the lowest intensity of sound at which 50% of the words are repeated correctly by the patient. Speech discrimination scores test the capacity of the patient to understand speech. Hence, speech audiometry is a <strong>subjective</strong> test.</p>\n<p>The<strong> rollover phenomenon</strong>&nbsp;is <strong>diagnostic</strong> of <strong>retrochochlear pathologies. </strong>Here, the phonetically balanced <strong>word score</strong> <strong>falls</strong> with an increase in speech intensity above a particular level due to <strong>nerve fatigue</strong>.
