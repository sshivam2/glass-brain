As a result, the <strong>donor twin shrinks</strong> with oligohydramnios<strong>, anemia, hypotension</strong>, and <strong>hypovolemia</strong>, while the <strong>receptor twin grows</strong> larger with polyhydramnios<strong>, polycythemic, hypertensive</strong>, and <strong>hypervolemic</strong> characteristics. Due to severe oligohydramnios, the donor twin may seem \"stuck\". The <strong>hemoglobin</strong> concentration differential between the two is typically <strong>greater than 5 g%</strong>, and the estimated <strong>fetal weight discrepancy</strong> is at least <strong>25%</strong>.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis of TTTS is based on two <strong>sonographic criteria</strong>. First is the identification of a monochorionic pregnancy, and second is the identification of polyhydramnios (LVP &gt; 8 cm) in one fetus and oligohydramnios (LVP &lt; 2 cm) in the other. Growth discordance is seen but is not a diagnostic criterion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Management of this condition is usually with <strong>obliteration</strong> of some of the <strong>shared vessels</strong> as it can lead to <strong>heart failure</strong> in the <strong>hyperperfused twin</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP)</strong> is a complication seen in <strong>monochorionic multifetal </strong>gestation. It is caused by a <strong>large artery-to-artery</strong> or <strong>vein-to-vein placental</strong> <strong>shunt</strong>. Unlike TTTS, there is no arteriovenous anastomosis. The recipient twin lacks a cardiac system, while the donor twin does the work of supplying blood for both twins. Blood from the donor twin reaches the iliac vessels of the recipient twin through the umbilical arteries. Therefore the <strong>recipient twin</strong> appears <strong>malformed</strong>, as only the lower body is developed, while the upper body is poorly developed. The <strong>donor twin</strong> may show signs of <strong>heart failure</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Single uterine artery</strong> is a malformation seen in some fetuses with an associated genetic condition. However, the presence of a small and large fetus should raise concerns about interfetal transfusion syndrome.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Twin anemia\u2013polycythemia sequence (TAPS) </strong>is similar to<strong> </strong>TTTS, where the<strong> donor twin </strong>is<strong> </strong><strong>anemic</strong> and <strong>smaller</strong> than the<strong> recipient</strong> twin, which is <strong>polycythemic. However, unlike TTTS, </strong>the<strong> amniotic fluid volumes </strong>in<strong> TAPS </strong>are similar for both fetuses.</p>",

The alveolar-capillary endothelial cells and type I pneumocytes are injured, with a breach in the tight alveolar barrier. Proinflammatory cytokines like IL-8, IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, and LT-B4 lead to the recruitment of neutrophils and the development of a hyaline membrane in the alveoli.</p>\n<p><strong>Proliferative phase:</strong> Occurs from day 7-21. Recovery from mechanical ventilation is seen in most patients. Some patients may develop pulmonary fibrosis in this stage. Histological recovery is seen in this phase with a shift to lymphocyte predominant infiltrates. Type II pneumocytes proliferate and secrete surfactant with subsequent differentiation to Type I pneumocytes.</p>\n<p><strong>Fibrotic phase:</strong> Is associated with increased mortality. Extensive alveolar duct and interstitial fibrosis are seen.</p>\n<p>Chest X-ray features in ARDS:</p>\n<p>Chest x-ray features usually develop <strong>12-24 hours</strong> after initial lung insult as a result of proteinaceous interstitial edema. Within one week, hyaline membrane occurs due to type 1 pneumocyte damage.
