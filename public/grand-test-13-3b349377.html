The recruitment of leukocytes to the site of injury involves the following steps:</p>\n<p><strong>Margination and rolling</strong>: Leukocytes assume a peripheral position along the endothelial surface because of stasis of blood flow and start rolling on the vessel wall because of signaling molecules from the endothelium; Mediated by: <strong>E-Selectin, P-Selectin, Glycam-1 and CD34.</strong><br /><strong>Adhesion</strong>: Leukocytes are attached to the endothelium because of adhesion molecules that are activated by cytokines. Mediated by: <strong>ICAM-1, VCAM-1.</strong><br /><strong>Diapedesis/Transmigration: </strong>of the leukocytes across the vascular endothelium. Mediated by: <strong>PECAM-1.</strong><br /><strong>Migration:</strong> towards a chemotactic stimulus in the extravascular tissues.

Chemokines that are produced at the site of injury bind to the endothelial cell proteoglycans. These chemokines then bind to the rolling leukocytes and activate them. This in turn converts the ligands for <strong>\u03b21 and \u03b22 integrins, VLA-4, and LFA-1 </strong>present on the leukocytes to a high-affinity state.</p>\n<p>This combination of cytokine-induced expression of integrin ligands on the endothelium and increased integrin affinity on the leukocytes leads to firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

Orlistat acts in the lumen of stomach and small intestine by forming covalent bonds with the active site of lipases. This leads to <strong>reduced digestion and absorption</strong> <strong>of dietary fat</strong>. <strong>Adverse effects</strong> include <strong>flatus with discharge, fecal urgency, fatty/oily stool</strong>, and <strong>increased defecation</strong>. These side effects are experienced early and <strong>diminish</strong> as patients <strong>control their dietary fat intake</strong>. <strong>Vitamin supplements</strong> are indicated to prevent fat soluble vitamin deficiency.<br /><br /><strong>Adjuvant pharmacologic treatments</strong> for <strong>obesity</strong> should be considered for patients with a <strong>BMI \u226530 kg/m2</strong>, or for patients with a <strong>BMI \u226527 kg/m2 </strong>who have <strong>concomitant obesity-related diseases</strong> and for whom <strong>dietary and physical activity therapy</strong> has <strong>not been successful</strong>.

Some examples of commonly done tuning fork tests are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Rinne&rsquo;s test</strong>&nbsp;is done by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the patient&rsquo;s mastoid and when he stops hearing, it is brought beside the external auditory meatus (EAC). If he still hears the sound, air conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC). The inferences are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rinne's test is considered&nbsp;<strong>positive (normal)</strong>&nbsp;when the air conduction<strong>&nbsp;AC&gt;BC</strong>&nbsp;is seen in normal people and people with <strong>sensorineural deafness</strong>.</li>\n<li>It is considered&nbsp;<strong>negative</strong>&nbsp;when the&nbsp;<strong>BC&gt;AC,</strong>&nbsp;and is seen in patients with&nbsp;<strong>conductive deafness</strong>. It suggests a minimum hearing loss of&nbsp;<strong>15-20 dB.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Weber test&nbsp;</strong>is done by placing a&nbsp;vibrating tuning in the middle of the forehead or the vertex and the patient is asked in which ear the sound is heard. The inferences are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Normal result is achieved when the sound heard equally in both ears</li>\n<li>In conductive deafness, it is lateralized to the worse ear</li>\n<li>In <strong>sensorineural deafness</strong>, it is <strong>lateralized</strong> to the <strong>better ear</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Conductive hearing loss</strong> in the<strong> right ear</strong> presents with a negative Rinne's test (BC&gt;AC) and Weber's test lateralized to the right ear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Conductive hearing loss</strong> in the<strong> left ear</strong> presents with a negative Rinne's test&nbsp;(BC&gt;AC)and Weber's test is lateralized towards the left ear.</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Sensorineural hearing loss</strong> in the<strong> left ear</strong> presents with a positive Rinne's test&nbsp;(AC&gt;BC) and Weber's test is lateralized towards the right ear.</p>",

This results in <strong>dilution of the extracellular fluid and hyponatremia</strong>.</p>\n<p>In psychogenic polydipsia, the serum osmolality is low, reflecting the diluted extracellular fluid. The urine sodium is also low, as the kidneys are attempting to excrete excess water. However, the urine osmolality is also low, indicating that the kidneys are not effectively concentrating urine. This is because the <strong>excessive water intake</strong> has <strong>suppressed</strong> the production of <strong>ADH</strong>, which is necessary for the kidneys to concentrate urine.</p>\n<p>Types of hyponatremia:</p>\n<p><strong>Hypovolemic hyponatremia,</strong> patients have a volume deficit due to loss of fluids rich in sodium. There is volume depletion but the depletion of sodium is relatively more than the depletion of water. This may be due to extra-renal or renal causes.In the case of extra-renal causes, there is hypovolemia due to fluid loss in conditions such as diarrhoea, vomiting, burns, etc. due to which sodium is lost along with the fluid and hence urine sodium concentration will also be low. However, in case of renal loss, the sodium is lost at the nephron level itself, causing increased urine sodium concentration, as seen in adrenal insufficiency.<br /><strong>Euvolemic hyponatremia</strong>, there is no volume depletion, but low sodium concentration relative to the total body water, as seen in conditions such as hypothyroidism and SIADH.<br /><strong>Hypervolemic hyponatremia</strong>, patients are in a condition of fluid overload. In case of fluid overload due to acute or chronic renal failure, urine sodium concentration will be high.\u00a0<br />In case of fluid overload due to cirrhosis, CCF and nephrotic syndrome, urine sodium concentration will be low.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A. Hypovolemia, SOsm &lt;275 mOsm/kg, UNa &lt; 40 mEq/L:</p>\n<p>This describes a patient with <strong>hypovolemic hyponatremia</strong>. The <strong>low SOsm</strong> reflects the <strong>diluted extracellular fluid </strong>and the <strong>low UNa</strong> indicates that the <strong>kidneys </strong>are trying to <strong>conserve sodium</strong>, which is a <strong>compensatory</strong> mechanism in response to hypovolemia. Possible causes of this presentation include <strong>non renal salt losses</strong>:<strong>\u00a0</strong>severe vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration.</p>\n<p>Option C. Euvolemia, SOsm &lt;275 mOsm/kg, UOsm &gt; 100 mOSm/kg</p>\n<p>This option describes a patient with <strong>euvolemic hyponatremia</strong>. The low SOsm reflects diluted serum due to excess reabsorption. However, the high UOsm indicates that the kidneys are <strong>able to concentrate urine</strong>, which suggests that the hyponatremia is not due to a problem with the kidneys' ability to conserve water. This is seen in <strong>SIADH.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D: Hypervolemia, SOsm &lt;275 mOsm/kg, UNa &lt;25 mEq/L:</p>\n<p>This option describes a patient with hypervolemic hyponatremia. The low SOsm reflects the diluted ECF.

It includes <strong>atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia</strong>, junctional tachycardia, and AV reentry tachycardia. <strong>Initial management</strong> of PSVT is by vagal maneuvers such as <strong>carotid massage</strong>. If this method is ineffective, <strong>intravenous adenosine</strong> is used which will terminate the majority of PSVT episodes by<strong> blocking the conduction at AV node</strong>. <strong>Beta-blockers</strong> and non-DHP calcium channel blockers like <strong>Verapamil</strong> and <strong>Diltiazem</strong> are also able to block AV nodal conduction and can therefore be used in patients with PSVT.</p>\n<p><strong>Verapamil</strong> is a class IV anti-arrhythmic agent. It is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts by slowing down the SA node automaticity and AV nodal conduction velocity. This <strong>decreases</strong> the <strong>conduction velocity</strong> and <strong>prolongs</strong> the <strong>refractory period</strong>, leading to the effective termination of the re-entrant current. Additionally, they also decrease cardiac contractility and reduce blood pressure.
