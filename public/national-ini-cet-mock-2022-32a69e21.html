Since the question only mentions a focal abnormality, hysteroscopy and selective biopsy is a better choice for this patient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Menopause</strong> is defined as the <strong>absence of menstruation</strong> for <strong>one year</strong> <strong>after</strong> the <strong>age of 40 years</strong>. But it is usually seen around<strong> 45</strong> to <strong>47 years</strong> of age. Any vaginal bleeding that occurs <strong>after menopause</strong>&nbsp;or even after just <strong>6 months</strong> of amenorrhea in menopausal age group women is defined as <strong>postmenopausal bleeding</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All postmenopausal women with unexpected uterine bleeding should be evaluated for <strong>endometrial carcinoma</strong>. Investigations used for diagnosing the cause of postmenopausal bleeding:</p>\n<p>Outpatient procedures -&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transvaginal ultrasound</strong> is the <strong>first-line</strong> investigation that checks for endometrial thickness. An endometrial thickness of <strong>&gt;4mm </strong>calls for further investigation by endometrial biopsy.</li>\n<li><strong>Endometrial sampling using Pipelle aspirator</strong> - aspiration of the uterine cavity and sending the sample for histopathological examination. It is used as a <strong>screening test</strong> in menopausal women on HRT or tamoxifen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inpatient procedures -&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fractional curettage</strong> (dilatation and curettage) of the <strong>endometrial</strong> and the <strong>endocervical tissue</strong> helps to know the site of malignancy, the extent of spread, and also staging of the tumor. It is the <strong>best test</strong> to perform if cancer is suspected as the cause of bleeding. This requires general anesthesia.</li>\n<li><strong>Hysteroscopic inspection &amp; selective biopsy</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<strong>gold standard</strong> procedure to&nbsp;diagnose<strong> focal endometrial lesions</strong>. It can be performed as an outpatient procedure as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The image below gives a summary of the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding, as per the FOGSI guidelines.</p>",

Pharmacotherapy is&nbsp;not commonly used, however it is reasonable to use medications for specific symptoms for a brief period of time.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Depression</strong> usually leads to <strong>impairment</strong> of <strong>daily</strong> <strong>activity</strong> and <strong>loss </strong>of <strong>interest </strong>since this <strong>patient&nbsp;</strong>is trying to work towards improving his condition, he is unlikely to have depression. Furthermore,&nbsp;<strong>atypical depression</strong> is characterised by <strong>overeating</strong> and <strong>increased sleep</strong>, whereas,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>this patient has a loss of appetite, and disturbed sleep.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Options C and D: <strong>PTSD&nbsp;</strong>is a psychiatric disorder characterised by <strong>increased stress</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong>&nbsp;<strong>after</strong> a stressful or<strong> traumatic event</strong>. Examples include witnessing or being involved in violent accidents, crime, <strong>war</strong>, natural disasters, life-threatening illnesses, etc. Symptoms of PTSD can be divided into four types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intrusion symptoms - flashbacks</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Hyperarousal</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Avoidance symptoms&nbsp;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Negative&nbsp;cognitions&nbsp;</strong>associated with the traumatic event</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Acute stress disorder</strong> presents with the same symptoms as PTSD, but the symptoms usually occur immediately after the trauma and persist for a period of <strong>3</strong> <strong>days to up to 1 month</strong> after the trauma.</p>\n<p>Based on the duration between the event and the presentation of symptoms, stress disorder is classified as follows:</p>\n<table style=\"height: 5px; width: 429px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 170px;\"><strong>Duration</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 243px;\"><strong>Condition</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 170px;\">3 days to 1 month</td>\n<td style=\"width: 243px;\"><strong>Acute stress reaction</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 170px;\">More than 1 month</td>\n<td style=\"width: 243px;\"><strong>Post-traumatic stress disorder</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 170px;\">Symptoms occur after 6 months of the stressor event</td>\n<td style=\"width: 243px;\"><strong>Delayed Post-traumatic stress disorder</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Chromosomal instability / APC-&beta;-catenin pathway / classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence</strong> is the <strong>most common pathway</strong> accounting for 80% of sporadic cancers. The <strong>\"first-hit\"</strong> in this pathway is the <strong>inherited </strong>or<strong> acquired&nbsp;mutation</strong> of the cancer suppressor gene&nbsp;<strong>APC </strong>on<strong> chromosome 5q21. </strong>But,<strong> both copies</strong> of the <strong>APC</strong> gene must be <strong>inactivated.</strong> The <strong>\"second hit\"</strong> is due to methylation abnormalities. This results in the loss of both APC alleles. The APC protein normally promotes the degradation of&nbsp;&beta;-catenin. Since it is lost, &beta;-catenin accumulates and translocates to the nucleus. This causes activation of transcription of genes that promote proliferation.</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 816\">Mutations of&nbsp;<strong>K-RAS </strong>on<strong> chromosome 12p12</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>TP53 </strong>on<strong> chromosome 17p13</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>LOH </strong>at<strong> chromosome 18q21</strong> are involved in <strong>further steps</strong> of the&nbsp;classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence.</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 816\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 816\"><strong>2.

During<strong> breast surgery</strong>, removal of axillary lymph nodes is common. This carries a risk of injury to the <strong>long thoracic nerve</strong>, which originates from the C5-C7 roots of the brachial plexus.&nbsp;It innervates the serratus anterior muscle. Injury to this nerve during surgery results in paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle leading to <strong>winging of the scapula.</strong></p>\n<p>2. <strong>Thyroid surgery</strong> may cause injury to both <strong>external</strong> and <strong>recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN)</strong>. The&nbsp;upper part of the RLN is closely related to the inferior thyroid artery. Hence, during thyroidectomy surgeries, there might be unilateral or bilateral<strong>&nbsp;recurrent laryngeal nerve</strong> injury. Unilateral RLN injury may be<strong>&nbsp;asymptomatic</strong>&nbsp;but in a few may cause&nbsp;<strong>hoarseness of voice.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><strong>Bilateral recurrent laryngeal</strong>&nbsp;nerve&nbsp;<strong>palsy</strong>&nbsp;can also occur postoperatively. It causes&nbsp;<strong>dyspnea</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>stridor</strong>&nbsp;but the voice is good. These cases required&nbsp;<strong>emergency tracheostomy.</strong></p>\n<p>3. <strong>Thymectomy</strong> is performed for patients with myasthenia gravis and thymoma. During surgery, the entire thymus and all accessible fatty areolar tissue in the mediastinum are removed. This ensures the removal of all ectopic thymic tissues and hence a reduction in tumor recurrences. Preservation of the <strong>phrenic nerves</strong> is an important component of the surgery as it causes <strong>diaphragmatic weakness.</strong></p>\n<p>4. An important structure traversing through the <strong>parotids</strong> is the <strong>facial nerve.</strong> During&nbsp;<strong>parotidectomy, </strong>the facial nerve is dissected and preserved as well as possible depending on the type of parotid surgery. Though all the branches of the facial nerve could be injured, weakness is mostly in the marginal mandibular branch territory as it is stretched during surgery and presents as <strong>weakness of the lower lip</strong> in the affected side.</p>",
