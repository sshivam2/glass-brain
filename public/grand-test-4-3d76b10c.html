The&nbsp;<strong>most common </strong>approach<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a&nbsp;<strong>sub-xiphoid approach</strong>&nbsp;under echocardiographic guidance.</p>\n<p>This patient has <strong>multiple rib fractures</strong> which likely have pierced the pericardium and/or the heart muscle. This leads to the accumulation of blood in the pericardial space. This space is <strong>non-distensible</strong> so fluid can compress the heart and impair contraction leading to <strong>decreased cardiac output</strong>. It also obstructs venous return which further reduces filling.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Cardiac tamponade</strong>&nbsp;is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. It will result in the obstruction of the blood flow into the ventricles.</p>\n<p>This manifests as&nbsp;<strong>Beck's triad,</strong> which consists of the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distended neck veins (due to decreased venous return)</li>\n<li>Muffled heart sounds (fluid accumulation in the pericardial space)</li>\n<li>Hypotension</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>chest wall movements</strong> will be <strong>normal</strong>. Echocardiography may show the swinging heart sign which suggests pericardial effusion with tamponade. An eFAST is reliable and will show fluid in the pericardial space. A chest X-ray will show an enlarged heart shadow.</p>\n<p>Cardiac tamponade can also be treated with open surgery procedures like <strong>sternotomy</strong> or <strong>left thoracotomy</strong>. This also allows for the heart to be repaired during the procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A: A <strong>pericardial window</strong> done via the <strong>subxiphoid</strong> or <strong>trans-diaphragmatic</strong> approach is the<strong> best</strong> way to diagnose and treat cardiac tamponade. It allows for drainage of blood and exploration of the area for the damage. It must be done under general anesthesia.&nbsp;This is the<strong> definitive management</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Chest tube insertion</strong> is used in massive <strong>hemothorax.</strong> Here, the accumulation of blood in the cavity severely restricts lung movements leading to inadequate ventilation. An appropriately placed chest tube can rapidly drain large amounts of blood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Analgesia</strong> is administered in cases of<strong> flail chest</strong>. This is because the pain from the rib fractures will further compromise respiratory movements. This patient's chest movements are normal. It is supplemented with oxygen administration and physiotherapy.&nbsp;</p>",
