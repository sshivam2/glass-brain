On\u00a0the contrary, a bicornuate uterus would have an external indentation at the fundal midline exceeding 50% of the uterine wall thickness.</p>\n<p>Note: Uterus didelphys is an anomaly that arises from the <strong>incomplete fusion</strong> of the Mullerian ducts, resulting in two entirely separate hemiuteri, two cervices, and a longitudinal vaginal septum running between the two cervices in most cases.
