However, it is still useful if performed within 12 hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Along with general measures in MI management,\u00a0systemic and coronary <strong>perfusion</strong> should be <strong>maintained</strong>. This is done by using vasopressors and fluids to ensure optimum left ventricular filling pressure to raise the blood pressure. The goal should be a <strong>mean arterial pressure of 60-65mmHg</strong> or systolic blood pressure of 90mmHg.

The use of catecholamines has the risk of inducing arrhythmias or increasing myocardial oxygen demand so if used, the administration should not be prolonged.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Intraaortic balloon pump</strong> is a type of mechanical circulatory support device that is inserted into the aorta.

The superficial cervical plexus provides a\u00a0<strong>cutaneous sensation</strong> of the skin between the<strong> trigeminal innervation </strong>of the<strong> face </strong>and the <strong>T2 dermatome </strong>of the<strong> trunk</strong>. The deep cervical plexus innervates the musculature of the neck.</p>\n<p><strong>Cervical plexus blocks</strong> (CPB) are techniques of regional anaesthesia that is used to provide anaesthesia/analgesia in various head and neck surgeries.</p>\n<p>The <strong>superficial</strong> cervical block is achieved by inserting a 22-gauge needle, at the <strong>midpoint</strong> of the <strong>posterior border</strong> of the <strong>sternocleidomastoid</strong> muscle. The needle is inserted 4 cm deep, and 5 mL of the solution is <strong>injected</strong> along the <strong>posterior border</strong> and the <strong>medial surface</strong> of the sternocleidomastoid.</p>\n<p>This technique can be used for surgeries like</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carotid endarterectomy\u00a0</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Thyroidectomy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Tracheostomy</strong></li>\n<li>Lymph node dissection</li>\n<li>Plastic surgery repairs</li>\n<li>Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy</li>\n<li>External ear surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>complications</strong> that may occur are inadvertent intravascular injection; phrenic nerve injury (rare); blocking of the accessory nerve, leading to the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscle weakness; and puncture of the internal jugular vein and carotid artery.</p>\n<p>This technique is <strong>contraindicated</strong> if there is an <strong>active infection</strong> overlying the injection site, <strong>contralateral phrenic nerve palsy,</strong> previous neck <strong>surgery</strong> and<strong> radiation</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>allergy</strong> to injected drugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Interscalene block</strong> results in the blockade of the <strong>superficial</strong> and <strong>middle trunks </strong>of the<strong> brachial plexus</strong>. To perform this technique, the patient should be in the supine position, with the head turned away from the side to be blocked. The interscalene groove is palpated. A transverse line from the cricoid cartilage is drawn to intersect the interscalene groove. This point of intersection indicates the transverse process of C6 where the drug is administered.</p>",

All neuromuscular blocking agents are quaternary ammonium compounds with an affinity for <strong>nicotinic ACh receptors</strong> due to the positively charged nitrogen present in them.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Depolarising muscle relaxants </strong>(DMRs), such as <strong>succinylcholine\u00a0</strong>(SCh) closely resemble the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). When administered, they rapidly bind to the ACh receptors on the muscle end-plate and cause depolarization. Unlike ACh, DMRs are not metabolized by the acetylcholinesterase\u00a0enzyme. This results in their prolonged presence in the synaptic cleft. As a result, there is <strong>continuous endplate depolarization.</strong></p>\n<p>This continuous endplate depolarization does not allow the endplate to repolarize. Hence, the time-limited perijunctional sodium channels that were inactivated during depolarization fail to re-open. This leads to muscle relaxation.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-Depolarising muscle relaxants\u00a0</strong>(NDMRs)\u00a0such as <strong>atracurium, pancuronium,</strong> etc compete with ACh and bind to its receptors, preventing the action of ACh on its receptors. However, the NDMRs are incapable of inducing the conformational change necessary for ion channel opening. Hence, their binding does not lead to the development of end-plate potential.</p>\n<p>Thus, <strong>DMRs </strong>behave as <strong>ACh receptor agonists </strong>while<strong> NDMRs </strong>behave as <strong>competitive antagonists.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>In the given clinical scenario, where there is a history of a <strong>chronic denervation injury</strong>, the physiological response is that of <strong>overexpression</strong> of <strong>ACh</strong> <strong>receptors</strong> on the muscle membranes. These overexpressed receptors are low conductance receptors with a prolonged opening time, similar to fetal nicotinic ACh receptors.</p>\n<p>The prolonged opening time of these receptors leads to an exaggerated response to DMRs. Whereas, the increased number of receptors leads to resistance to the action of NDMRs, as the NDMRs now cannot block all these receptors. The net effect is an <strong>exaggerated response to DMR </strong>and<strong> resistance to NDMR.</strong></p>\n<p>The opposite happens in conditions like <strong>myasthenia gravis</strong>, where the number of ACh receptors is greatly reduced. This leads to an <strong>exaggerated response to NDMRs</strong> due to complete antagonism of all receptors and <strong>resistance to DMRs</strong> due to an inadequate number of receptors being depolarized. (Option C)</p>\n<p>Options A and B are not possible in this scenario.</p>",
