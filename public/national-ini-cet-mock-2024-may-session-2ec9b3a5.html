The next step in the management of this condition is to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus with the help of <strong>prostaglandin E1 infusion. </strong></p>\n<p>After confirmation of the diagnosis and the neonate is stabilised, surgical repair should be performed.</p>\n<p>Coarctation refers to a constriction or narrowing in the aorta, which can be proximal or distal to the ductus arteriosus. CoA usually presents either in <strong>infancy </strong>or in <strong>later childhood</strong>.</p>\n<p>In infancy , once the ductus arteriosus starts to close , the infant presents as <strong>lower body hypoperfusion</strong> , respiratory distress due to<strong> congestive heart failure</strong> since blood flow through the aorta is restricted by the coarctation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the ductus arteriosus is open in an infant with severe coarctation, the left-to-right shunt established during birth across the ductus arteriosus during birth is reversed to <strong>right-to-left shunt</strong> as there is the presence of coarctation above the ductus in aorta. This leads to deoxygenated blood flow to the lower limbs and no change in pulse in the lower limbs.</p>\n<p>As the ductus arteriosus closes, there is pooling of blood in the heart leading to congestive heart failure, further leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance as well as lack of blood flow to lower limbs (presenting as weak pulses in the lower extremities).</p>\n<p>Treatment includes re-establishing patency of the ductus arteriosus by <strong>prostaglandin E1 infusion\u00a0</strong>and heart failure medical management followed by definitive surgical management such as <strong>coarctectomy</strong> and <strong>end to end anastomosis</strong> or <strong>patch aortoplasty</strong>. Restenosis of CoA areas later in childhood are common and are treated by <strong>balloon angioplasty.</strong></p>\n<p>Coarctation of the aorta in older children or adolescents presents as incidental <strong>upper limb hypertension</strong> and disparity of pulses in upper limb and lower limb as <strong>radio-femoral delay.</strong> Other complaints include <strong>weakness or pain/claudication</strong> in the legs after exercise.

It is usually not effective in term neonates with PDA, hence surgical ligation is preferred in such cases. Other uses of indomethacin include <strong>prophylaxis </strong>for<strong> pulmonary hemorrhage </strong>in extremely low birth weight\u00a0infants.</p>\n<p>Option D - Diclofenac is not used in treatment of congenital heart diseases.</p>",

Type II error refers to <strong>rejecting the alternative (or experimental) hypothesis</strong> when it is true in reality i.e. <strong>false-negative error</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Factors that <strong>increase </strong>the power of a study:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing <strong>p</strong> <strong>value or probability value </strong>(from 0.05 to 0.1). This increases the chance obtaining a statistically significant result (rejecting the null hypothesis) when the null hypothesis is actually false. So, it <strong>reduces</strong> the risk of a <strong>type II error</strong> (false negative error). However, this would also result in an increase in the type I error (alpha error or false-positive error).</li>\n<li>A larger <strong>size of the difference</strong> between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean (this is known as the <strong>effect size</strong>). For example, a difference between a hypothesized population mean IQ of 135 and a sample mean IQ of 100 would be detected much more easily (and hence the null hypothesis would be rejected more easily - power of study) than a difference between a hypothesized IQ of 135 and a sample mean IQ of 128.\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Decreasing sampling error. </strong>The <strong>precision</strong> with which the data are measured also influences statistical power.

This occurs because the effect size is easier to detect as the sample size increases. A\u00a0large-scale study is more likely to detect a <strong>false null hypothesis</strong> (particularly if the effect size is small) than is a small-scale study. For example, if a coin is tossed 1,000 times, resulting in 600 heads and 400 tails (effect size 200), it is much easier to reject the null hypothesis (that the coin is a fair one) than if the coin is tossed 10 times and 6 heads and 4 tails are obtained (effect size 2).</li>\n</ul>",

Thus the ligament gets stretched and vulnerable to injury. On slipping off a pavement or into a pothole the foot gets plantar-flexed and inverted predisposing the ATFL to injury.</p>\n<p>The lateral collateral ligaments consist of the <strong>anterior talofibular</strong>, the<strong> posterior talofibular, </strong>and (between them) the <strong>calcaneofibular ligaments</strong>. The <strong>calcaneofibular ligament</strong> runs from the tip of the lateral malleolus to the posterolateral part of the calcaneum and, therefore helps to <strong>stabilize the subtalar joint</strong>. The <strong>posterior talofibular ligament</strong> runs from the posterior border of the lateral malleolus to the posterior part of the talus.</p>\n<p>The medial collateral (<strong>deltoid</strong>) ligament consists of <strong>superficial </strong>and<strong> deep portions.</strong> The superficial fibers spread like a fan from the medial malleolus anteriorly to the navicular and inferiorly to the calcaneum and talus. Its chief function is to <strong>resist </strong>the<strong> eversion of the hindfoot</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The deep portion is intra-articular, running directly from the medial malleolus to the medial surface of the talus.

It acts by competitively inhibiting acetylcholine in the N<sub>m\u00a0</sub>receptor and producing prolonged depolarization of the membrane leading to brief periods of repetitive excitation(fasciculations) initially, followed by blocking of neuromuscular transmission and flaccid paralysis(phase I block). It will worsen the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic crisis.</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Atropine</strong> is an<strong> anticholinergic drug</strong> which acts by competitively inhibiting acetylcholine binding on muscarinic receptors and thereby causing <strong>anti-muscarinic effects</strong>. It has <strong>no action </strong>on <strong>nicotinic receptors</strong> and hence not useful in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Edrophonium</strong> is a quarternary amine which acts as a <strong>short acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</strong> leading to prolonged Ach binding to the N<sub>m</sub> receptors and thereby <strong>increasing muscle excitation shortly</strong>. It is used as a <strong>diagnostic test</strong> to differentiate between <strong>myasthenia crisis</strong> and a <strong>cholinergic crisis</strong>.</p>\n<p>The edrophonium test is performed by rapid intravenous injection of <strong>2 mg</strong> of edrophonium chloride, followed 45 seconds later by an additional 8 mg if the first dose is without effect. A <strong>positive response</strong> or an <strong>improvement in muscle weakness</strong> implies a\u00a0\u00a0<strong>myasthenic crisis</strong> and a <strong>negative response</strong> or <strong>worsening of muscle weakness</strong> implies <strong>cholinergic crisis</strong>(excessive Ach in the N<sub>m</sub> receptors leading to prolonged depolarisation like succinyl choline). The duration of action is approximately for 10 minutes.</p>",

The <strong>contrast agents</strong> used for <strong>MRI</strong> are <strong>gadolinium</strong> and <strong>USPIO </strong>(Ultra-Small Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide) which\u00a0are paramagnetic substances which can change the local magnetic field.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gadolinium acts by reducing both <strong>T1 </strong>and <strong>T2 </strong>relaxation time of the tissue. The predominant effect is on T1, so post-contrast is a T1 weighted image. Since free gadolinium ion is <strong>toxic</strong>, Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) is used. Gadolinium does not cross the <strong>blood-brain barrier</strong> unless the barrier is disrupted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contraindications for Gadolinium:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Renal failure </strong>- Gd-DTPA is predominantly excreted through the kidney. Hence, in renal failure, it gets accumulated in the body and releases gadolinium ions. Since the ion is toxic, the body tries to contain it by fibrosis resulting in multisystem painful fibrosis called <strong>nephrogenic systemic fibrosis</strong>. As a result, gadolinium-containing contrast is contraindicated in patients with an estimated GFR under 60 ml/min and especially under 30 ml/min.</li>\n<li><strong>Pregnancy </strong>- Due to the risk of teratogenicity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gadobutrol </strong>(gadolinium-based contrast agent) is the first and only contrast agent approved by the FDA for the use of cardiac MRI in adult patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.</p>\n<p><strong>USPIO </strong>is a T2 agent and is usually taken by cells of the <strong>reticuloendothelial system</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Gastrografin</strong> and <strong>Iohexol</strong> are <strong>iodinated </strong>contrast agents.

Iohexol is used as an intravascular contrast medium for radiography such as CT scans and in the diagnostic work-up of esophageal perforation.
