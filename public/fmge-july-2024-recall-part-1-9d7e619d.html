Metoclopramide is useful in this condition because it <strong>increases LES tone,</strong> preventing acid reflux, and enhances gastric emptying by promoting gastrointestinal motility. Additionally, it reduces nausea and vomiting by <strong>blocking dopamine D2 receptors</strong> in the central nervous system. These combined effects help alleviate the symptoms and discomfort associated with GERD.</p>\n<p>Metoclopramide works in GERD by enhancing gastrointestinal motility through its <strong>antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors</strong>. In GIT, <strong>acetylcholine increases gastrointestinal motility </strong>and <strong>increases the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone.</strong> Therefore, <strong>D2 receptor inhibition</strong> augments <strong>ACh release </strong>and <strong>enhances GI motility</strong> and <strong>LES tone</strong>. Additionally, it exerts antiemetic effects by blocking D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the central nervous system. The combined actions help alleviate symptoms associated with GERD.</p>\n<p>Metoclopramide is a <strong>prokinetic</strong> and <strong>antiemetic</strong>.

The drug is more potent than morphine as an antidiarrheal agent and penetrates the CNS poorly. It is effective in patients with <strong>5-fluorouracil-induced diarrhea</strong> and can be regarded as the <strong>treatment of choice</strong>. Loperamide is effective against <strong>traveler\u2019s diarrhea</strong> and can be used alone or in combination. If clinical improvement in acute diarrhea does not occur within 48 hours, loperamide should be discontinued.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Diphenoxylate</strong>\u00a0is an <strong>opioid agonist</strong> that is structurally similar to meperidine. It is used in the treatment of <strong>acute, chronic, and traveller's diarrhea</strong>. Upon administration, it undergoes de-esterification to difenoxin, which is its active metabolite.

    "solution": "<p>The histopathological findings and clinical history are suggestive of <strong>tuberculosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Once <strong>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </strong>enters the macrophage, it inhibits the formation of the phagolysosome. This allows it to replicate unchecked. M. tuberculosis recruits a host protein coronin to block the fusion of phagosome and lysosome. <strong>Th1 </strong>response to M. tuberculosis is mounted about three weeks following the infection. The <strong>antigen-presenting cells</strong> (APCs) present mycobacterial antigens to the T-cells in the lymph nodes and release IL-12 and IL-18 to cause the differentiation of T-cells into Th1 cells. Th1 cells produce <strong>IFN-\u03b3</strong>. IFN-\u03b3 is the critical step in the body's defense against M. tuberculosis. It acts by activating macrophages, causing phagolysosome maturation, and inducing nitric oxide synthase enzyme to form more reactive nitrogen species. It also mobilizes anti-bacterial compounds like defensins and stimulates autophagy.</p>\n<p>Th1 response leads to the formation of a granuloma and <strong>caseous necrosis.</strong> Macrophages that are activated by the action of IFN-\u03b3 differentiate into <strong>epithelioid histiocytes</strong>. These are the cells that actually aggregate to form a granuloma. Some epithelioid cells may also fuse to form a <strong>giant cell.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>microscopic</strong> <strong>picture</strong> shows the <strong>caseating granuloma.</strong> Eosinophilic necrotic debris known as <strong>caseation</strong>, bordered by collections of <strong>epithelioid cells,</strong> Langhan giant cells and lymphocytes can be seen.

    "solution": "<p><strong>Subarachnoid haemorrhage</strong> will <strong>persist</strong> when <strong>washed under running water</strong> during an autopsy.</p>\n<p>Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding in the space between the brain and the arachnoid membrane which is the <strong>subarachnoid space</strong>. During an autopsy, the blood from a subarachnoid haemorrhage is not easily washed away by running water. This is because it is located in this deep layer, which can trap the blood within the brain's sulci and gyri.</p>\n<p>While doing the autopsy, there is typically some fresh blood present. However, it <strong>cannot be washed off</strong> because the blood is situated beneath the <strong>very thin and transparent arachnoid layer.</strong></p>\n<p>This makes the blood from a SAH less likely to be displaced compared to haemorrhages located in other regions, such as epidural or subdural spaces. Thus, despite running water during an autopsy, the blood from a subarachnoid haemorrhage often remains in place, making it detectable even after washing.</p>",
