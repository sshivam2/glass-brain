The <strong>secretion</strong> of<strong> protons</strong> by an activated <strong>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase</strong> (proton pump) in the <strong>parietal cells</strong> into the gastric lumen is the <strong>final step</strong> involved in the production of<strong> gastric acid</strong>&nbsp;and inhibition of this enzyme prevents acid secretion into the stomach.</p>\n<p>Once PPIs irreversibly inactivate the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane. This leads to <strong>prolonged suppression of acid secretion</strong> for up to 24-48 hours, despite having a shorter plasma half-life of only 30 minutes to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>In most individuals, once-daily dosing is enough to achieve effective acid inhibition. If necessary, a second dose can be given before an evening meal.</p>\n<p>The number of H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump molecules increases after fasting and food decreases the oral bioavailability of the drug. Hence, PPIs are given around 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.</p>\n<p>PPIs <strong>cannot inhibit</strong> all gastric acid pumps with oral dosing because <strong>not all pumps are active</strong> during the short half-life of the PPI in the blood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PPIs cause maximum suppression of gastric acid. They reduce the daily production of <strong>both basal</strong> and <strong>stimulated acid secretion</strong> by 85&ndash;90%.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are available in the form of <strong>delayed-release</strong> tablets, capsules, and oral suspension packets and for immediate acid suppression, there are <strong>intravenous formulations</strong> for PPIs like lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole. Therefore, the <strong>release of the drug</strong> depends upon the drug <strong>formulation.</strong></p>",

Paraplegic patients, elderly patients, and severely ill patients are at a higher risk of developing pressure sores.</p>\n<p>They are staged as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 1</strong> - Erythema with no blanching and no breach in the epidermis.</li>\n<li><strong>Stage 2</strong>- Partial-thickness skin loss with epidermal and dermal involvement.</li>\n<li><strong>Stage 3</strong>- Full-thickness skin loss with intact fascia but the involvement of the subcutaneous tissue.</li>\n<li><strong>Stage 4</strong>- <strong>Full-thickness skin loss</strong> extending to the fascia with <strong>massive tissue destruction</strong> and<strong> involvement </strong>of <strong>muscle</strong>, bone, tendon, or joint.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Management is primarily proper skin care with pressure dispersion cushions, air-fluidized beds, and urinary or fecal diversion if required.
