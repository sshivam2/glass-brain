It causes hypotension.</p>\n<p>Anaphylaxis is a <strong>severe,</strong> potentially <strong>life-threatening allergic reaction</strong> that occurs rapidly and affects the whole body. It is characterized by a sudden release of <strong>histamines</strong> and other chemicals from the <strong>immune system</strong> in response to an <strong>allergen,</strong> such as certain foods, medications, insect stings, or latex. The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to a few hours after exposure to the allergen.</p>\n<p>Clinically, anaphylaxis can present with a combination of symptoms that typically include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Respiratory</strong> Symptoms: Patients often experience wheezing and respiratory distress due to bronchoconstriction. Other signs may include shortness of breath, coughing, and a feeling of tightness in the chest.</li>\n<li><strong>Skin</strong> Symptoms: Urticaria (hives) and angioedema (swelling of the skin and mucous membranes) are common. These skin reactions usually develop rapidly, often within minutes to two hours of exposure to the allergen.</li>\n<li><strong>Cardiovascular</strong> Symptoms: Hypotension (low blood pressure) is a key indicator of anaphylaxis. Patients may also experience tachycardia (increased heart rate) and, in severe cases, shock.</li>\n<li><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> Symptoms: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps can occur, particularly if the anaphylaxis is triggered by food allergens.</li>\n<li><strong>Neurological</strong> Symptoms: Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness can occur due to the sudden drop in blood pressure and reduced oxygen supply to the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specific diagnostic <strong>criteria</strong> for anaphylaxis include the presence of <strong>acute</strong> onset <strong>symptoms</strong> involving the <strong>skin, mucosal</strong> tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula), plus <strong>respiratory compromise</strong> (e.g., <strong>dyspnea, wheezing-bronchospasm, stridor,</strong> reduced peak expiratory flow), or <strong>hypotension</strong> or associated symptoms of <strong>end-organ dysfunction</strong> (e.g., hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence). Alternatively, it can be diagnosed if <strong>two or more</strong> of the following occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen: involvement of the <strong>skin-mucosal</strong> tissue, <strong>respiratory</strong> compromise, <strong>hypotension</strong>, or persistent <strong>gastrointestinal</strong> symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt treatment</strong> is critical in <strong>managing anaphylaxis.</strong> The <strong>first-line</strong> treatment is the immediate administration of <strong>intramuscular epinephrine,</strong> which counteracts the effects of histamines and other chemicals released during the reaction. Additional treatments may include <strong>antihistamines, corticosteroids,</strong> and <strong>bronchodilators</strong> to manage symptoms and prevent further complications.</p>\n<p>Patients with a history of <strong>anaphylaxis</strong> are typically advised to carry an <strong>epinephrine auto-injector </strong>at all times and to seek emergency medical care immediately if they experience symptoms of anaphylaxis. Long-term management may involve identifying and avoiding known allergens, as well as potentially undergoing allergen immunotherapy in certain cases.</p>",

An ultrasound can <strong>assess for complications</strong> of gallstones, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or obstruction of the bile ducts. In cases where ultrasound findings are inconclusive or further characterisation is needed, other imaging modalities such as CT scan or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be used.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option D: The mSv (millisievert) value for a non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan of the head typically ranges from around<strong> 1 to 2 mSv</strong>.

The forward flow of aqueous is blocked as the tips of ciliary processes rotate forward and press against the lens/IOL/anterior hyaloid of the vitreous. Hence, aqueous humor collects in the vitreous cavity. There is <strong>persistent shallow or flat anterior cha</strong>mber</p>\n<p>Option C: In Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis, the IOP is not usually so high.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Phacomorphic glaucoma</strong> is an acute secondary angle-closure glaucoma caused by an intumescent cataractous lens due to rapid maturation of cataract or following traumatic capsular rupture. The swollen lens obliterates the angle by forcing the root of the iris against the cornea. The patient presents with features of acute glaucoma with a <strong>shallow anterior chamber</strong> and a swollen cataractous lens.</p>",

The sediment is neutralised with N/10 HCl for further use. Avoid excessive alkali exposure.</li>\n<li><strong>NALC (N-acetyl cysteine) with 2% NaOH</strong>: This method is superior to Petroff's, NALC liquefies sputum while NaOH eliminates contaminating bacteria.
