    "solution": "<p><strong>Pyroptosis</strong> is a form of apoptosis that occurs due to the activation of<strong> caspase 1.</strong></p>\n<p>Pyroptosis occurs due to the release of fever-inducing cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1). Cytoplasmic innate immune receptors recognize <strong>microbial products</strong> that entered the infected cells and activate the multiprotein complex called the <strong>inflammasome</strong>. Inflammasome activates <strong>caspase 1</strong> and helps in the release of the biologically activated forms of <strong>IL-1</strong>.&nbsp;Along with caspase 1, caspases 4 and 5 also induce cell death. Unlike classical apoptosis, pyroptosis is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apoptosis- The intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic death receptor-initiated pathways converge to activate a caspase cascade that mediates the final phase of apoptosis. The <strong>intrinsic pathway </strong>activates<strong> caspase 9</strong> whereas the <strong>extrinsic pathway</strong> activates <strong>caspases 8 </strong>and<strong> 10</strong>. These caspases then activate<strong>&nbsp;caspase 3, </strong>and<strong> caspase 6</strong>.&nbsp;Activated caspases cause DNA degradation and nuclei fragmentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ferroptosis</strong> is an <strong>iron-dependent</strong> distinct pathway of <strong>cell death</strong> induced<strong> by</strong> <strong>lipid peroxidation</strong>. The widespread peroxidation disrupts membrane function which leads to the loss of plasma membrane permeability and results in cell death resembling necrosis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Necroptosis</strong>, as the name suggests has features similar to necrosis and apoptosis. Like necrosis,&nbsp;it is characterized by loss of ATP, cellular and organelle swelling, the release of lysosomal enzymes, and rupture of the plasma membrane. However, like apoptosis, this is programmed cell death. Ligation of <strong>TNFR1</strong> initiates necroptosis. This is a <strong>caspase-independent</strong> programmed cell death.</p>",
