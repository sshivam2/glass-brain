They are usually <strong>solitary</strong>, <strong>central</strong>, metaphyseal lesions of tubular bones, which usually affect the <strong>small bones </strong>of the<strong> hand</strong> and <strong>feet</strong> followed by the femur and humerus. Enchondromatous tumours typically begin and grow in childhood arising from rests of growth plate cartilage or\u00a0chondrocytes that proliferate and enlarge, then stop growing but remain present throughout adulthood.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase is an enzymatic component of the Krebs cycle which helps to convert isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate.\u00a0Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 result in the alteration of the enzyme function and in increased levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG.). This elevation in D-2-HG results in inhibition of the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells; blocking osteogenic differentiation during the formation of the skeleton results in cartilaginous tumor formation.</p>\n<p><strong>Microscopically</strong>, enchondromas appear as grey-blue, translucent, hypocellular, non-vascular tumors with abundant hyaline cartilage.

Niacin can also result in <strong>hyperuricemia</strong> and may <strong>reactivate gout.</strong> Hence, a history of <strong>gout</strong> is a <strong>relative contraindication</strong> for niacin.</p>\n<p><strong>Niacin</strong> is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin and is the only vitamin that affects that lipid levels. Niacin acts by <strong>inhibiting</strong> the <strong>lipolysis</strong> of triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase in the adipose tissue. Niacin reduces the free fatty acid transport to the liver and decreases triglyceride synthesis by inhibiting both the synthesis and esterification of fatty acids. There is also a <strong>reduction</strong> of <strong>very-low-density lipoprotein</strong> (VLDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by decreasing their productivity and enhancing their clearance. <strong>High-density</strong> lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are <strong>raised</strong> due to the decreased clearance of apo A-1 in HDL.</p>\n<p>The indications of niacin are <strong>hypertriglyceridemia</strong> and <strong>elevated LDL cholesterol.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>most common </strong>serious side effect of niacin is <strong>hepatotoxicity</strong>. Other\u00a0adverse effects of niacin include\u00a0<strong>dyspepsia</strong>, <strong>cutaneous</strong>\u00a0<strong>flushing, and pruritus. </strong>Flushing\u00a0and pruritus\u00a0can be controlled<strong>\u00a0</strong>with aspirin as they are prostaglandin mediated. Concurrent use of niacin with a statin can result in myopathy. Niacin is avoided in pregnant females as it resulted in birth defects in experimental animals.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options A and B- <strong>Cholestyramine</strong> and <strong>colestipol</strong> are bile acid sequestrants. These are highly positively charged and bind to negatively charged bile acids resulting in their excretion in the stool. Hepatic cholesterol content reduces due to the increased bile acid synthesis. This increases the LDL receptors in the liver resulting in increased LDL cholesterol clearance. These agents are relatively safe but <strong>severe hypertriglyceridemia</strong> is a <strong>contraindication</strong> to its use as these agents increase the triglyceride levels.</p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>Clofibrate</strong> is a halogenated fibric acid derivative. Fibrates bind to PPAR-\u03b1 and reduce triglycerides through PPAR-\u03b1 mediated stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, increased lipoprotein lipase synthesis, and reduced expression of apo C-III. The adverse effects include rash, urticaria, hair loss, myalgias, fatigue, headache, and impotence. Clofibrate can result in myopathy and gall stone formation. Fibrates should not be used in children or pregnant women. <strong>Renal failure</strong> and <strong>hepatic dysfunction</strong> are <strong>relative contraindications</strong> to the use of fibrates.</p>",

This shift induces autonomic responses. It is characterized by more GI and fewer cardiovascular effects.\u00a0It appears to be secondary to the release of several humoral agents, such as serotonin, bradykinin-like substances, neurotensin, and entero- glucagon.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Late dumping syndrome</strong> is due to the high carbohydrate load in the small intestine, which causes an increase in insulin levels and secondary hypoglycemia. This hypoglycemia activates the adrenal gland to release catecholamines, which results in diaphoresis, tremulousness, light-headedness, tachycardia, and confusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dietary manipulation is the mainstay of treatment of early dumping syndrome.

It not only inhibits gastric emptying but also affects small bowel motility. Hence, the intestinal transit of the ingested meal is prolonged.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Oral rehydration solution</strong> (ORS) is used for the supportive treatment of diarrhoea.\u00a0The absorption of water and nutrients is dependent on the osmotic gradient created by sodium transport via neutral NaCl absorption, sodium absorption coupled to the absorption of organic solutes such as glucose and electrogenic sodium absorption. In diarrheal disease, disruption of these processes occurs except the absorption of sodium, coupled with glucose and other organic solutes. The preservation of this facilitated cotransporter is the scientific rationale for the development of the ORS.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Surgical treatment</strong> is considered when all other methods fail; available options include pyloric reconstruction or conversion to a Roux-en-y gastrojejunostomy.</p>",
