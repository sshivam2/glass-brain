Histopathology of the tumor shows small round cells with large nuclei. Microscopic features includes&nbsp;<strong>Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes</strong>(highly specific of retinoblastoma)<strong>, Homer-Wright rosettes, pseudorosettes, and fleurettes formation</strong>. Areas of necrosis and calcification can also be seen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Cavernous hemangioma </strong>is the most common primary&nbsp;<strong>benign</strong>&nbsp;orbital tumor<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in<strong>&nbsp;</strong>adults. They are composed of <strong>large, </strong>dilated <strong>vascular</strong> channels; are more <strong>infiltrative</strong>; frequently involve <strong>deep</strong> structures; and <strong>do not</strong> spontaneously regress. On <strong>histologic</strong> examination, the mass is sharply delineated but unencapsulated with large, cavernous blood-filled vascular spaces, separated by connective tissue stroma.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Orbital cellulitis</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<strong>most common </strong>cause of<strong> unilateral proptosis </strong>in children<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;It&nbsp;refers to the acute infection of the contents of the orbit&nbsp;<strong>behind</strong>&nbsp;the orbital septum. Features include&nbsp;pain, lid edema, erythema, chemosis, and&nbsp;<strong>axial proptosis.&nbsp;</strong>Increased pain with movement of eyes and&nbsp;<strong>ophthalmoplegia</strong>(decreased ocular motility) is a classic symptom.&nbsp;With posterior exenteration cavernous sinus thrombosis, subdural empyema, and intracranial abscess develop.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
