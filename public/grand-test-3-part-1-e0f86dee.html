This reduction in the heart rate <strong>decreases the myocardial oxygen demand.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The oxygen requirement of the heart mainly depends on the work done by the heart. This work mainly depends on cardiac output and peripheral resistance. An increase in these parameters will increase the oxygen requirement of the heart.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Important determinants of cardiac output are:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Stroke volume</strong>- It is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat. This stroke volume increases whenever, there is <strong>increased venous</strong> return to the heart, increased end-diastolic volume (<strong>preload</strong>), and increased contractility. Contractility further depends on the <strong>initial length</strong> of the cardiac muscle fiber and the <strong>autonomic innervation.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Heart rate</strong>- Increased heart rate increases the cardiac output which in turn increases the oxygen requirement. Heart rate\u00a0is controlled primarily by the autonomic nerves, with sympathetic stimulation increasing the rate and parasympathetic stimulation decreasing the rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afterload-</strong> The tension at which the load is lifted is called afterload. As the afterload increases, the heart has to work more in order to pump blood to the organs. This in turn results in increased oxygen requirement. It is dependent on the <strong>peripheral resistance.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Drugs used in the management of angina either decrease the work done by the heart or increases the blood flow to the heart.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Nitrates</strong>- They increase the cGMP and cause venodilation. It mainly results in an increase in venous capacitance and a decrease in the ventricular preload. They might also increase coronary flow in some areas and in variant anginas.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong>- Blocking the calcium channels leads to the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles and decreased impulses in the conduction system. This leads to decreased peripheral resistance,\u00a0decreased blood pressure, decreased contractility, decreased heart rate, and decreased oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Beta-blockers</strong>- They decrease the oxygen requirement by decreasing the\u00a0heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility. Some drugs like carvedilol and nebivolol also cause vasodilation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Newer antianginal drugs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Ranolazine-\u00a0</strong>It inhibits the late sodium current and reduces the intracellular calcium concentration. It reduces diastolic tension, cardiac contractility, and work.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Trimetazidine</strong>- inhibits the fatty acid oxidation in the myocardium. It decreases the oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Ivabradine-\u00a0</strong>decreases the heart rate and decreases oxygen requirement.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Fasudil-\u00a0</strong>It is a Rho kinase inhibitor.

This condition arises due to<strong> thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency</strong>, which impairs the function of the <strong>pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme</strong>. The current standard of <strong>treatment</strong> for patients with symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy is to give <strong>thiamine 100 mg intravenously before administering glucose-containing IV fluids</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Thiamine</strong> is an essential cofactor for the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, a key component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.

This biochemical disturbance contributes to the neurological symptoms observed. Immediate administration of thiamine is crucial in treating Wernicke's encephalopathy.

A patient who consumes <strong>non-iodized salt</strong> and has weight gain, constipation, hair loss, and fatigue has hypothyroidism due to <strong>iodine deficiency</strong>. The reason for the presence of goiter in this condition is<strong> elevated </strong>plasma<strong> TSH levels</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Goitre</strong> is the <strong>diffuse enlargement</strong> of the thyroid gland. It may be seen in hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and euthyroidism as well. It is caused by the action of<strong> excess TSH </strong>or substances similar to TSH on the thyroid gland. This is due to the <strong>trophic action</strong> of <strong>TSH </strong>on the thyroid gland i.e. it causes<strong> hypertrophy</strong> and <strong>hyperplasia</strong> of the <strong>follicular cells.</strong></p>\n<p>In patients with <strong>iodine deficiency</strong>, the production of thyroid hormones is impaired and features of <strong>hypothyroidism</strong> develop. <strong>Decreased</strong> levels of the <strong>thyroid hormones</strong> result in <strong>increased TSH </strong>secretion from the anterior pituitary via negative feedback. TSH stimulates hypertrophy and hyperplasia of follicular cells and the secretion of large amounts of thyroglobulin. Thus, the thyroid gland enlarges. This condition is known as <strong>endemic goiter.</strong></p>\n<p>Other causes of <strong>hypothyroidism</strong> resulting in goiter are <strong>autoimmune thyroiditis, deiodinase deficiency</strong>, and disorders of iodide trapping, peroxidase, or coupling systems. Consumption of food containing <strong>goitrogenic</strong> <strong>substances</strong> (eg: turnips, cabbages) also results in goiter.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Wolff-Chaikoff effect </strong>is the transient inhibition of the organification of iodide when<strong> large doses</strong> of<strong> iodide</strong> are consumed. This results in a decrease in thyroid hormone synthesis. \u00a0This effect will not be seen in this patient who consumes non-iodized salt.</p>\n<p>Option C: In <strong>Grave\u2019s disease</strong>,<strong> TSH-receptor antibodies</strong> are present. They act similar to TSH and stimulate excessive secretion of thyroid hormones. Patients with Grave\u2019s disease present with goiter, weight loss, exophthalmos, tremors, and tachycardia. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Mucopolysaccharide</strong> deposition is the mechanism of <strong>myxedema</strong> formation in <strong>hypothyroid </strong>patients.

The <strong>secretion</strong> of<strong> protons</strong> by an activated <strong>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase</strong> (proton pump) in the <strong>parietal cells</strong> into the gastric lumen is the <strong>final step</strong> involved in the production of<strong> gastric acid</strong>\u00a0and inhibition of this enzyme prevents acid secretion into the stomach.</p>\n<p>Once PPIs irreversibly inactivate the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane. This leads to <strong>prolonged suppression of acid secretion</strong> for up to 24-48 hours, despite having a shorter plasma half-life of only 30 minutes to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>In most individuals, once-daily dosing is enough to achieve effective acid inhibition.
