    "solution": "<p>Flooding is not a part of systematic desensitization.</p>\n<p><strong>Systematic desensitization&nbsp;</strong>is based on the behavioral principle of <strong>counterconditioning</strong> and was developed by Joseph Wolpe. Counterconditioning involves a <strong>gradual approach</strong> to a <strong>feared situation</strong>, in a psychophysiological state that inhibits anxiety, to overcome the maladaptive anxiety elicited by that situation. It works best in cases of a clearly identifiable anxiety-provoking stimulus. It has been successfully used in the treatment of phobias, obsessions, compulsions, and certain sexual disorders.</p>\n<p>It consists of three steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relaxation training</strong> - Patients attain a state of complete relaxation and are then exposed to the stimulus that elicits the anxiety response. Relaxation methods like <strong>yoga</strong>, <strong>progressive relaxation</strong>, <strong>hypnosis</strong>, and <strong>mental imagery</strong> can be used. The physiological changes during the relaxation process; slow heart rate, increased peripheral blood flow, and neuromuscular stability; are opposite to that of the adrenergic response invoked during anxiety. The relaxed state inhibits the negative reaction of anxiety associated with the phobia and this is known as <strong>reciprocal inhibition</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Hierarchy construction&nbsp;</strong>- The therapist determines all the conditions that elicit anxiety and the patients prepare a <strong>graded list or hierarchy</strong> of 10-12 fear-provoking scenes in the order of increasing anxiety.</li>\n<li><strong>Desensitization of the stimulus&nbsp;</strong>- Patients proceed systematically through the list from the least to the most anxiety-provoking scene while in a deeply relaxed state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Flooding</strong>&nbsp;involves repeated and prolonged exposure to fear cues of high intensity<strong>&nbsp;without</strong>&nbsp;a<strong>&nbsp;hierarchy</strong>. It is based on the premise that anxiety gets reinforced by conditioning when the patient escapes from the anxiety-provoking situation. Patients are encouraged to face the feared situations directly and are prevented from escaping. There is <strong>no gradual build-up</strong> or use of relaxation techniques.</p>\n<p>Phobia refers to&nbsp;<strong>excessive fear</strong>&nbsp;of a specific circumstance, situation, or object. A&nbsp;<strong>specific phobia</strong>&nbsp;is a strong and per&shy;sisting fear of a particular situation or an object.&nbsp;<strong>Exposure</strong>&nbsp;or<strong>&nbsp;anticipation</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>contact</strong>&nbsp;with the situation/object triggers an&nbsp;<strong>anxiety reaction</strong>. This inadvertently leads to&nbsp;<strong>panic attacks</strong> in people who are susceptible. The person goes to great lengths to avoid this situation or object. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5), &nbsp;phobias are classified under&nbsp;<strong>Anxiety disorders</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Behavior therapy</strong> is considered the <strong>most effective</strong> treatment for phobias. Systemic desensitization is the most common behavior therapy used for phobias. Other modes of treatment of phobias include insight-oriented psychotherapy, virtual therapy, hypnosis, and family therapy.</p>",

Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On the passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.&nbsp;</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paresthesia:&nbsp;</strong>Paresthesia and hypoesthesia may be noted due to compression of nerves traversing the affected compartment. They are the first signs of nerve ischemia.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pallor: </strong>Pallor of the skin may not always be seen. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paralysis:</strong>&nbsp;Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a <strong>late sign</strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pulselessness:&nbsp;</strong>Usually, the peripheral pulses and&nbsp;capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the <strong>intra-compartmental pressure</strong>&nbsp;using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as the&nbsp;differential pressure (&Delta;P). A&nbsp;<strong>differential pressure (&Delta;P)</strong> of <strong>less than&nbsp;30 mm Hg</strong> (4.00 kilopascals) is an <strong>indication</strong> for <strong>immediate compartment decompression</strong>.</p>\n<p>The threatened compartment must be promptly decompressed, merely splitting the plaster is not helpful and the limb must be <strong>kept flat.</strong>&nbsp;This is because elevating the limb causes a further decrease in end capillary pressure and aggravates muscle ischemia. In the case of compartment syndrome in the leg, <strong>fasciotomy </strong>should be performed. This involves&nbsp;opening all four compartments via medial and lateral incisions. Wounds to be left open and<strong> inspected 2 days</strong> later, if tissues are healthy, the wounds can be sutured. If there is muscle necrosis, debridement to be carried out.</p>",
