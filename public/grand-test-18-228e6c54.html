DCM is the <strong>most common cardiomyopathy </strong>and is predominantly characterised by systolic dysfunction. The familial form is due to<strong> mutations</strong> in the <strong>TTN gene</strong> which encodes the <strong>sarcomeric protein titin</strong>. Other etiological agents include alcohol, infective myocarditis, doxorubicin, hemochromatosis and sarcoidosis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Restrictive cardiomyopathy </strong>(RCM) is characterized by <strong>increased ventricular stiffness</strong> causing impaired diastolic filling of the ventricles. The stiffness is secondary to an underlying disease causing accumulation of intra and intercellular substances in the myocardium. <strong>Causes</strong> of RCM include <strong>infiltration disorders </strong>like<strong> amyloidosis (most common)</strong> and <strong>sarcoidosis</strong>, <strong>storage disorders</strong> like Fabry\u2019s disease and glycogen storage disease type II, fibrotic disorders like scleroderma, endomyocardial fibrosis and Loeffler's endo myocarditis.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy </strong>(HCM) is the <strong>most common genetic cardiovascular disorder</strong> and is a prominent cause of <strong>sudden death </strong>before the age of 35 years. Sudden death can be due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy</strong> is an <strong>autosomal dominant disorder </strong>that classically manifests with right-sided heart failure and rhythm disturbances, which can cause sudden cardiac death. Many of the causal mutations involve genes encoding desmosomal junctional proteins at the <strong>intercalated disk</strong> as well as proteins that interact with the desmosome (e.g., the intermediate filament <strong>desmin</strong>).</p>",

UPJO is more common in <strong>males</strong> and occurs more frequently on the <strong>left</strong> side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most cases of PUJO with associated hydronephrosis are now detected before birth with <strong>antenatal ultrasound</strong>. If undetected, it presents in infancy as a palpable renal mass. Associated presentations include abdominal or flank pain, febrile UTI, or hematuria after minimal trauma.</p>\n<p>The causes of UPJ obstruction are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intrinsic</strong> (due to an <strong>adynamic</strong> or stenotic segment of the proximal ureter) or\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Extrinsic</strong> (e.g. compression by accessory renal arteries). This needs to be corrected primarily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>renal anatomy</strong> and <strong>function</strong> can be assessed using <strong>radio scintigraphy</strong> studies.

Mild cases with grade 1 or 2 hydronephrosis and normal renal parenchyma are managed with observation and subsequent renal ultrasound studies to monitor the severity.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> of intrinsic UPJ obstruction is done <strong>surgically</strong> if renal function is compromised or if there is bilateral involvement of the kidneys. In other cases, serial follow-up with ultrasonography is done to assess the spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis.</p>\n<p>Its indications include persistent pain, hypertension, haematuria, secondary renal calculi and recurrent UTIs due to the UPJO.

The <strong>secretion</strong> of<strong> protons</strong> by an activated <strong>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase</strong> (proton pump) in the <strong>parietal cells</strong> into the gastric lumen is the <strong>final step</strong> involved in the production of<strong> gastric acid</strong>\u00a0and inhibition of this enzyme prevents acid secretion into the stomach.</p>\n<p>Once PPIs irreversibly inactivate the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane. This leads to <strong>prolonged suppression of acid secretion</strong> for up to 24-48 hours, despite having a shorter plasma half-life of only 30 minutes to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>In most individuals, once-daily dosing is enough to achieve effective acid inhibition. If necessary, a second dose can be given before an evening meal.</p>\n<p>The number of H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump molecules increases after fasting and food decreases the oral bioavailability of the drug. Hence, PPIs are given around 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.</p>\n<p>PPIs <strong>cannot inhibit</strong> all gastric acid pumps with oral dosing because <strong>not all pumps are active</strong> during the short half-life of the PPI in the blood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>PPIs cause maximum suppression of gastric acid. They reduce the daily production of <strong>both basal</strong> and <strong>stimulated acid secretion</strong> by 85\u201390%.\u00a0<br /><br />There are available in the form of <strong>delayed-release</strong> tablets, capsules, and oral suspension packets and for immediate acid suppression, there are <strong>intravenous formulations</strong> for PPIs like lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole. Therefore, the <strong>release of the drug</strong> depends upon the drug <strong>formulation.</strong></p>",
