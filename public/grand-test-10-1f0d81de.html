It is seen in children. The first episode is managed by digital repositioning. If there is a recurrence, then Theirsch's wiring or sclerotherapy is done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2)<strong>&nbsp;Complete rectal prolapse</strong>- in this type, all the layers of the rectum are prolapsed. It is seen in adults due to the weakening of the pelvic floor. It is managed by using the following approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The perineal approach</strong>- It is easy to perform, has fewer complications but a high recurrence rate. It is preferred in elderly patients with comorbidities. The surgeries done using this approach for rectal prolapse are the following:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thiersch's wiring</strong>- A steel wire/silastic/nylon tape is placed around the anal canal. Largely obsolete now due to problems with chronic perineal sepsis, anal stenosis, and obstructed defecation. This procedure is rarely used now.</li>\n<li><strong>Delorme's mucosectomy</strong>- in this procedure, the rectal mucosa is stripped circumferentially from the rectum over the length of the prolapse.&nbsp;The underlying muscle is plicated with a series of sutures. The excess rectal mucosa is excised and a mucosal anastomosis is performed.</li>\n<li><strong>Altemeier's rectosigmoidoscopy</strong>- in&nbsp;this procedure, the rectum is prolapsed through the anal canal and a full-thickness resection is performed, incorporating any associated colonic prolapse. Restoration of colorectal continuity can be performed by hand-sewn/stapled anastomosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to <strong>discontinue unfractionated heparin and start lepirudin.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)&nbsp;</strong>results due to the formation of antibodies against <strong>heparin-platelet 4 complexes.&nbsp;</strong>These antibodies also bind to the platelet Fc receptors and promote thrombosis. Features of HIT are usually seen after 5-10 days of starting heparin and are more common in females than in males. The platelet count usually drops to less than&nbsp;&le;100,000/&mu;L or decreases to&nbsp;&ge;50% compared to the levels before the initiation of heparin. The patients can also show the features of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction due to extensive formation of thrombi.</p>\n<p><strong>Stop heparin</strong> immediately and start with&nbsp;parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, such as <strong>lepirudin, argatroban, or bivalirudin</strong>, or factor Xa inhibitors, such as fondaparinux or rivaroxaban. Do not give platelet transfusions. Warfarin is not given&nbsp;until the platelet count returns to its baseline level. Patients with HIT already have low levels of protein C. Giving warfarin to these patients without thrombin inhibitors further decreases its levels and causes skin necrosis. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should also not be used to treat HIT patients because most HIT antibodies exhibit cross-reactivity with LMWH.</p>\n<p><strong>Heparin&nbsp;</strong>acts by activating <strong>antithrombin</strong>.
