These features suggest the diagnosis of<strong>\u00a0reactive arthritis or\u00a0Reiter's syndrome</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Reactive arthritis</strong> (ReA) is a condition included in the spectrum of <strong>seronegative spondyloarthropathies</strong>. It is an acute asymmetric nonpurulent oligoarthritis precipitated by an antecedent gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection. It is characterized by a triad of <strong>arthritis, urethritis,\u00a0</strong>and<strong> conjunctivitis</strong>. It occurs most commonly in the age group 18-40 years and is <strong>associated</strong> with <strong>HLA-B27</strong>.</p>\n<p>Bacterial triggers for ReA are caused by Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>,\u00a0<em>Clostridium difficile</em>, certain toxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em><strong>Ureaplasma urealyticum</strong></em>, and <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>.</p>\n<p>The clinical features of reactive arthritis include constitutional symptoms like fever, malaise, fatigue, weight loss. Patients develop arthritis which is asymmetric and additive involving large weight-bearing joints like the knee and ankle. <strong>Sacroiliitis</strong> and spondylitis occur as late sequelae and are more commonly <strong>asymmetric</strong>. <strong>Non-marginal syndesmophytes</strong> which are comma-shaped arising from the middle of the vertebral body are seen. Dactylitis or sausage digit and enthesitis are also seen.</p>\n<p>Extraarticular manifestation of reactive arthritis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keratoderma blennorrhagica</strong>\u00a0presents as<strong>\u00a0</strong>vesicles and pustules that lead to hyperkeratotic lesions/crusting on the palms and soles.</li>\n<li>Oral ulcers: Superficial, transient, and often asymptomatic.</li>\n<li><strong>Circinate balanitis</strong>: consists of vesicles that rupture to form painless superficial erosions on the glans penis.</li>\n<li><strong>Anterior uveitis</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Conjunctivitis</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Laboratory investigations reveal elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Synovial fluid analysis shows inflammatory changes with negative culture. Joint radiograph shows juxta-articular osteoporosis, marginal erosions, loss of joint space, and periostitis with new bone formation.</p>\n<p>Treatment includes NSAIDs, intralesional glucocorticoids, and antibiotics during the antecedent infection.</p>",
