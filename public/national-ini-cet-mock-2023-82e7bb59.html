It is more commonly seen in diabetic nephropathy-induced destruction of juxtaglomerular apparatus, drugs like <strong>ACEI/ARBs</strong>, potassium-sparing diuretics, calcineurin inhibitors, NSAIDs, and heparin.</p>\n<p>The clinical features seen in Type IV RTA are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hyperkalemia</strong>: Hypoaldosteronism results in an increase in potassium concentration.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Metabolic acidosis</strong>: The important buffers in urine are ammonia and phosphate. Hyperkalemia impairs ammonia production in the proximal tubule, which reduces the buffering of hydrogen ions. This results in decreased hydrogen ion excretion.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Urinary pH&lt;5.5</strong>: Due to the decreased production of ammonia in the proximal tubule, excess protons are excreted in the renal tubules, thus decreasing the urinary pH.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>RTA type I</strong> (distal RTA) is seen in autoimmune diseases like Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, medullary sponge kidney disease, cirrhosis, drugs like amphotericin B, lithium, etc. The patients develop <strong>hypokalemia</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> with alkaline urine (urinary pH &gt;5.5).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>RTA type II</strong> (proximal RTA) is seen in Fanconi syndrome, Wilson's disease, heavy metals ingestion, etc., The patients develop <strong>hypokalemia</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> with acidic urine (urinary pH &lt;5.5). There is also the excretion of glucose, urate, and amino acids.</p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>RTA type III</strong> (mixed RTA) is seen in inherited mutations of carbonic anhydrase II. A combined pathology of type I and type II RTA is seen in this type. It results in <strong>hypokalemia</strong> and <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>.</p>",

Primary</strong> <strong>peristalsis </strong>occurs as a <strong>continuation of the peristaltic wave</strong> that begins in the <strong>pharynx</strong> and spreads into the esophagus during the pharyngeal stage of swallowing. It passes from the pharynx to the esophagus, within about <strong>8 to 10 seconds.\u00a0</strong>However, due to the effect of <strong>gravity</strong> in an upright position, the food passes within <strong>5 to 8 seconds.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>B. Secondary peristalsis\u00a0</strong>occurs if the <strong>primary peristaltic wave failed</strong> to empty the food from the esophagus into the stomach. Secondary peristalsis is initiated by the <strong>distension</strong> of the esophageal wall by the retained food. Waves continue until all the food is emptied into the stomach. Secondary peristaltic waves are initiated partly by<strong> intrinsic neural circuits</strong> in the <strong>myenteric nervous</strong> system <strong>and</strong> partly by<strong> reflexes that begin in the pharynx.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Control of peristaltic waves:\u00a0</strong>The musculature of the pharyngeal wall and <strong>upper third of the esophagus</strong> is <strong>striated muscle.</strong> These regions are controlled by skeletal nerve impulses from the <strong>glossopharyngeal</strong> and <strong>vagus</strong> nerves.</p>\n<p>The musculature of the <strong>lower two-thirds</strong> of the esophagus is <strong>smooth muscle.</strong>\u00a0This region is strongly controlled by the <strong>vagus</strong> nerves, which act through connections with the esophagal myenteric nervous system.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect of obliteration of vagal input to the esophagus</strong>: When the vagal nerves are cut, or the vagal input is obliterated by any other cause such as stroke, the <strong>primary peristalsis,</strong>\u00a0solely dependent on the vagal innervation, is <strong>eliminated.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>However, the <strong>intrinsic</strong> <strong>myenteric nerve plexus</strong> of the esophagus becomes excitable within days, causes strong <strong>secondary peristaltic waves</strong>.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0even after paralysis of the brain stem swallowing reflex, food fed by a tube into the esophagus passes into the stomach due to the secondary peristaltic movements.</p>",

These chemokines then bind to the rolling leucocytes and activate them. This, in turn, converts the ligands for\u00a0\u03b21 and\u00a0\u03b22 integrins, <strong>VLA-4,</strong> and <strong>LFA-1 </strong>present on the leucocytes to a <strong>high-affinity state</strong>.</li>\n<li>This combination of cytokine-induced expression of integrin ligands on the endothelium and increased integrin affinity on the leucocytes leads to firm <strong>adhesion</strong> of leucocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation.</li>\n<li>Leucocyte<strong> migration</strong>: This is the movement of leucocytes through the intact endothelium, called transmigration or diapedesis. This occurs in postcapillary venules. This migration occurs through the inter-endothelial gap towards the chemical concentration gradient created by the chemokines at the site of injury. This occurs with the help of adhesion molecules present in the intercellular junctions such as <strong>platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule</strong> (<strong>PECAM-1</strong>) or <strong>CD31</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>",
