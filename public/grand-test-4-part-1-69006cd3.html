It is characterized by diffuse <strong>parenchymal interstitial fibrosis</strong>. It predominantly affects the<strong>\u00a0lower lobes\u00a0</strong>of the lung, in contrast to other forms of pneumoconiosis, which affect the upper lobes and may present with dyspnoea and cough, usually after 20-30 years of exposure. Other asbestos-related diseases include <strong>pleural plaques, recurrent pleural effusions, lung carcinoma, </strong>and<strong> mesothelioma.</strong></p>\n<p>Workers in the <strong>cement, shipping, and textile</strong>\u00a0industries are at a higher risk of developing asbestosis. Asbestos tends to involve the pleura first.\u00a0The earliest manifestation is benign asbestosis-related<strong> pleural effusion.</strong> With time, the plaques are calcified resulting in the formation of <strong>thick pleural plaques.</strong> The pleural thickenings can be seen on the X-ray/ CT scan.

They appear as <strong>golden brown, fusiform, or beaded rods</strong>. These are formed when the asbestos fibers are phagocytosed by the macrophages and are coated by iron-containing proteinaceous material derived from phagocyte ferritin. Similar iron-protein complexes coat other inorganic particulates other than asbestos which are termed as<strong> ferruginous bodies</strong>.</p>\n<p>The image\u00a0below shows\u00a0<strong>asbestos bodies.</strong></p>",
