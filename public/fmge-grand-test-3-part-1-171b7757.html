These cells have a high turnover rate. The macrophages get stuffed in between along with cellular debris which are called\u00a0<strong>tingible body macrophages. </strong>Upon fixation, the cytoplasm washes away leaving behind white spaces filled with debris ( the \"stars\")<strong>. </strong>This produces a\u00a0<strong>starry sky appearance</strong>, which is classical of <strong>Burkitt lymphoma.\u00a0</strong></p>",
