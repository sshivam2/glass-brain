This results in the loss of sodium, chloride, and water contributing to the diuretic effect. The diuretic effect of thiazide leads to decreased osmotic pressure due to the loss of Na+, Cl-, and water leading to compensatory reabsorption of uric acid thus resulting in hyperuricemia. The intracytoplasmic Na+ concentration also decreases due to the blockade of the co-transporter. To compensate, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger pumps sodium from the systemic circulation into the epithelial cells in exchange for calcium. The declining calcium levels inside the cell will draw more calcium from the lumen into the systemic circulation. This results in hypercalcemia. There is also increased loss of Mg2+, K+, and H+.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanisms of antihypertensive action:</strong> Decreases plasma and ECF volume by diuresis thereby decreasing cardiac output. Even when the compensatory mechanisms restore the Na+ levels and plasma volume, a low BP is maintained by a reduction in total peripheral resistance.

It is due to the autoantibody-mediated destruction of the\u00a0<strong>acetylcholine receptors</strong>\u00a0(AChRs) at the <strong>post-synaptic</strong> membrane.\u00a0This consequentially leads to a\u00a0<strong>decreased transmission\u00a0</strong>at the<strong>\u00a0neuromuscular</strong>\u00a0<strong>junction</strong>. <strong>Failure of transmission</strong> results in muscle weakness.\u00a0Hence the goal is to increase the duration of action of acetylcholine by <strong>inhibiting acetylcholinesterase</strong>.

Hence, type 1 is far more severe and leads to <strong>kernicterus</strong> and neurological damage in <strong>babies</strong>. Type 2 may also lead to kernicterus occasionally. <strong>Unconjugated bilirubin is elevated</strong>.\u00a0Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a 20-year-old male is less likely to be due to Criggler Najar type 1 syndrome. It is because patients usually die in infancy or early childhood despite the best treatment.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Rotor syndrome </strong>is\u00a0similar to Dubin-Johnson syndrome but with a\u00a0<strong>milder</strong> presentation. <strong>Increased conjugated bilirubin</strong> levels.
