As the synovial membrane and subchondral bone have a common blood supply, a simultaneous infection may be seen.</p>\n<p>The patient presents with complaints of pain, swelling, fever and night sweats, loss of weight, and restricted joint movement. As articular erosion progresses, <strong>deformity</strong> of the joint becomes apparent. The patient begins <strong>limping</strong> and the knee is kept <strong>flexed</strong>. Discharging <strong>sinuses</strong> may be present.</p>\n<p>During the night, subsequent to local muscle relaxation, there is stretching to compression of the affected tissues at night, leading to periods of intense pain called '<strong>night cries</strong>'.</p>\n<p>An X-ray shows the bone ends having a '<strong>washed out</strong>' appearance with narrowing of joint space. Epiphyseal enlargement, soft-tissue swelling, and peri-articular osteoporosis are observed. In the later stages, there is subarticular bone erosion on both sides of the joint with an absence of periosteal reaction.</p>\n<p>On further investigation, the Mantoux test or Heaf test will be positive and there is an elevated ESR. Synovial fluid appears <strong>cloudy</strong> on aspiration; a culture of this fluid or that of synovial biopsy specimen shows the growth of <em>M.Tuberculosis</em>.</p>\n<p>Management involves both conservative and operative procedures. The affected knee is immobilized by below-knee skin traction and plaster of Paris cast above-knee. Antitubercular chemotherapy is started.</p>\n<p>Operative procedures are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Synovectomy</strong> in cases of synovial tuberculosis</li>\n<li><strong>Joint debridement</strong> when articular cartilage is preserved</li>\n<li><strong>Arthrodesis</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other options:<br /><br />Option A: <strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> is the chronic non-suppurative inflammation of the synovial joints. It occurs between the ages of 20 to 50 years and women are more commonly affected. The presence of four or more of the following is indicative of rheumatoid arthritis: Morning stiffness, swelling of three or more specified joints, swelling of joints in the hands and wrist, symmetrical swellings, rheumatoid nodule, rheumatoid factor positive, X-ray showing erosion or unequivocal peri-articular osteopenia.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Osteoarthritis</strong> is a degenerative disease primarily affecting the articular cartilage, which occurs in elderly people, mostly in weight-bearing joints of the lower limb such as the knee and hip when the disease is primary and is usually bilateral. Secondary osteoarthritis occurs due to an underlying disease of the joint such as avascular necrosis, coxa vara, and malunited fractures of the hip. It occurs at any age after adolescence and commonly affects the hip.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Psoriatic arthropathy</strong> presents as a polyarthritis, with the involvement of distal interphalangeal joints. It is also associated with the presence of psoriatic skin disease, nail disease characterized by onycholysis, pitting, splinter hemorrhages, and ocular disease in the form of uveitis.</p>",

It stimulates insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon release, delays gastric emptying, reduces food intake, and normalizes fasting and postprandial insulin secretion. It is given <strong>subcutaneously.</strong>&nbsp;It can also cause pancreatitis, and therefore is not used in patients with a history or risk of developing <strong>pancreatitis.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Teduglutide</strong> is a glucagon-like peptide-2 (<strong>GLP-2</strong>)&nbsp;analog.

Inflammasome activates <strong>caspase 1</strong> and helps in the release of the biologically activated forms of <strong>IL-1</strong>.&nbsp;Along with caspase 1, caspases 4 and 5 also induce cell death. Unlike classical apoptosis, pyroptosis is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apoptosis- The intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic death receptor-initiated pathways converge to activate a caspase cascade that mediates the final phase of apoptosis. The <strong>intrinsic pathway </strong>activates<strong> caspase 9</strong> whereas the <strong>extrinsic pathway</strong> activates <strong>caspases 8 </strong>and<strong> 10</strong>. These caspases then activate<strong>&nbsp;caspase 3, </strong>and<strong> caspase 6</strong>.&nbsp;Activated caspases cause DNA degradation and nuclei fragmentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ferroptosis</strong> is an <strong>iron-dependent</strong> distinct pathway of <strong>cell death</strong> induced<strong> by</strong> <strong>lipid peroxidation</strong>.

The <strong>intensity</strong> of this click sound changes <strong>depending </strong>on the<strong> left ventricular (LV) volume</strong>. When LV <strong>volume increases</strong>, the floppy valve is able to maintain tension, and the degree of prolapse is reduced. Thus the <strong>intensity</strong> of the murmur <strong>reduces.</strong> On the other hand, when the LV <strong>volume is low</strong>, the mitral valve leaflets remain floppy and produce a <strong>louder click</strong> sound.</p>\n<p>By this logic, when the patient <strong>stands up</strong>, the venous return reduces and so the<strong>&nbsp;LV volume decrease. </strong>This causes the<strong> murmur</strong> to become <strong>louder.</strong> On<strong> lying down</strong>, venous return increases, leading to <strong>increased LV volume</strong> and a <strong>softer murmur</strong>. On performing the <strong>Valsalva</strong> maneuver, intrathoracic pressure increases. This reduces venous return, and hence the <strong>murmur</strong> becomes <strong>louder</strong> because of <strong>reduced LV volume</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A - Mitral valve prolapse is also called <strong>Barlow's syndrome&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>floppy valve disease</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B -&nbsp; It is associated with connective tissue disorders like <strong>Marfan's syndrome</strong><strong>,</strong> Ehler's Danlos syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta.</p>\n<p>Option C - The valve becomes floppy due to <strong>myxomatous degeneration</strong> of the valve.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis can be made with a combination of clinical examination and <strong>transthoracic</strong> or <strong>transesophageal echocardiography.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> of these patients involves the usage of <strong>beta-blockers for palpitations</strong>. If the patient has <strong>severe symptoms</strong> due to <strong>mitral regurgitation,</strong> <strong>surgical repair</strong> is advisable. In case of prior history of endocarditis, prophylaxis for infective endocarditis should be prescribed.</p>",

Sciatica can either be because of inflammation of the sciatic nerve or because of compression of one of the roots constituting the sciatic nerve</li>\n<li>Option C: <strong>Vascular Claudication</strong> occurs due to injury to blood vessels and leads to exercise-induced ischemia. The collaterals are good enough to keep the limb viable but any further demand on the blood supply like walking uphill or riding a stationary bicycle causes ischaemic pain. Symptoms of vascular claudication reduce on taking rest or by standing still but spinal stenosis requires flexion for relief.</li>\n<li>Option D: <strong>Pott's Disease</strong>, that is, tuberculosis of the spine begins as a dull ache in the early stages and later becomes localized to the affected diseased segment. Other features like stiffness, cold abscess, constitutional symptoms will be present.</li>\n</ul>",
