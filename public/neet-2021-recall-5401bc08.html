It occurs due to mutation of the gene for the<strong> ryanodine</strong><strong>&nbsp;receptor </strong>(Ryr 1), located on chromosome 19. Ryr 1 is an ion channel responsible for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>\n<p>The symptoms develop when the patient is exposed to <strong>inhaled anesthetics</strong> (halothane in this case) or <strong>suxamethonium/succinylcholine.</strong></p>\n<p>The mutated Ryr 1 leads to&nbsp;a sudden release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the skeletal muscle. This&nbsp;<strong>uncontrolled increase</strong> in <strong>intracellular calcium</strong>&nbsp;removes the inhibition of troponin, resulting in <strong>sustained muscle contraction</strong>, which in turn, leads to an increase in adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity.

The occurrence of infections are largely based on the environmental conditions that the child is exposed to.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural influences:</strong> Poor diets as a result of cultural and regional influences also play a role in malnutrition. They are as follows with an example for each:\n<ul>\n<li>Food habits, traditions, customs, beliefs and attitudes: Rice and wheat are largely staple in India. Papaya is avoided as it is thought to cause abortion.</li>\n<li>Food fads: Personal likes and dislikes to a certain group of foods.</li>\n<li>Cooking practices: Prolonged boiling of cereals in open pans which leads to a loss of nutritive value</li>\n<li>Child-rearing practices: Premature curtailment of breastfeeding</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Socio-economic factors:</strong> Poverty plays a huge role in causing malnutrition.

This is carried out by reducing the bone resorption effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH).

    "solution": "<p>The source of blood glucose in a person<strong> fasting overnight</strong> for 11 hours (8 pm to 7 am) is<strong> hepatic glycogenolysis.</strong></p>\n<p>First stage of fasting: The fasting state begins <strong>two to four hours</strong> after the <strong>absorptive/well-fed state.</strong> In early fasting i.e; <strong>4-18 hours after the well-fed state,</strong> the blood glucose level is maintained by hepatic glycogenolysis. The glycogen stores are sufficient for around 18 hours after a meal following which they start to deplete. So the source of blood glucose in a person fasting for 11 hours will be liver glycogenolysis.<br /><br />Second stage of fasting:&nbsp;<strong>Gluconeogenesis</strong> begins 4&ndash;6 hours after the last meal but becomes fully active only after stores of liver glycogen are depleted<strong> (after 18 hours)</strong>. They can serve as a source of glucose for up to 2 days.</p>\n<p>Substrates for gluconeogenesis are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Glucogenic amino acids</strong> ( mainly alanine) from the muscle and</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Glycerol</strong> from adipose tissue&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During fasting, the glucogenic amino acids are transported to the liver, transaminated into pyruvate, and converted to glucose.</p>\n<p>Third stage of fasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Lipolysis</strong>&nbsp;occurs in the adipose tissue due to the activity of <strong>hormone-sensitive lipase,</strong> stimulated by <strong>increased glucagon:insulin ratio.</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Free fatty acids</strong> are the source of energy in this stage and not glucose. Triacylglycerols will be hydrolyzed to fatty acids and glycerol.&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Beta oxidation</strong> of fatty acids takes place which provides <strong>acetyl CoA.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">In prolonged starvation <strong>(&gt;3 days)</strong>, acetyl CoA is converted to <strong>ketone bodies</strong> in the liver which will act as the main fuel source for skeletal and heart muscle and can meet up to 20% of the brain&rsquo;s energy needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Final stage of fasting: After several weeks of starvation, ketone body synthesis will not take place due to depleted triacylglycerol stores. <strong>Proteins</strong> remain the only source of fuel. Protein degradation increases, and <strong>death</strong> results from a loss of heart, liver, or kidney function.</p>\n<p>Role of insulin and glucagon:</p>\n<p>When blood glucose falls during fasting, there is <strong>increased</strong> secretion of <strong>glucagon</strong> and <strong>decreased</strong> release of <strong>insulin.</strong> Hence <strong>glucagon:insulin ratio</strong> is <strong>increased.</strong></p>\n<p>Effects of increased glucagon:insulin ratio on enzymes of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">It activates <strong>glycogen phosphorylase,</strong> the key enzyme of glycogenolysis, and deactivates glycogen synthase.

It depresses the rapid phase of depolarization in Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle&nbsp;due to a decreased availability of fast sodium channels in cardiac membranes. This reduced rate of depolarization <strong>depresses myocardial contractility.</strong> Hence, bupivacaine is a potent cardio depressant.</p>\n<p>Cardio-vascular effects of bupivacaine-induced toxicity are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Left ventricular depression</li>\n<li>Atrioventricular heart block</li>\n<li>Ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation</li>\n<li>Sinus bradycardia can lead to cardiac arrest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initial management includes immediate initiation of<strong> cardiopulmonary resuscitation</strong> (CPR) and <strong>defibrillation</strong> as per the <strong>advanced cardiac life support</strong> (ACLS) algorithm.</p>\n<p>Following CPR, <strong>intralipid therapy</strong> is initiated.
