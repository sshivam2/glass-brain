This type of horizontal gene transfer may occur by two mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lytic cycle&nbsp;</strong>- In the lytic cycle, also known as the virulent cycle, a large number of progeny phages build up inside the host bacterium; eventually, the host cell ruptures, releasing the bacteriophages. Some of the bacteriophages will now contain bacterial DNA, which can then be transferred to other bacteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Lysogenic cycle&nbsp;</strong>- In the temperate or non-lytic cycle, the host bacterium is not lysed. Rather, the phage DNA becomes integrated with the bacterial chromosome. This phage DNA multiplies with the host cell and is transferred to daughter cells.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option A -&nbsp;<strong>Conjugation</strong> is the method of&nbsp;gene transfer in bacteria that involves physical contact by a male or donor bacterium with a female or recipient bacterium through an extracellular protein extrusion or appendage called the <strong>sex pili.</strong> The genetic material that is transferred is usually derived from plasmids.&nbsp;The bacteria that possess the ability to form the sex pili contain the F<sup>+</sup> plasmid and are designated as F<sup>+</sup>. The F<sup>+</sup> bacteria can transfer a single strand of the F<sup>+</sup> plasmid DNA to F<sup>-</sup> bacteria via the sex pili.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C -&nbsp;<strong>Transformation</strong> is the direct uptake of naked DNA by the bacterial cell from the environment. Several bacteria such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Neisseria</em> undergo transformation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D -&nbsp;<strong>Transposition</strong> is a process of gene transfer that involves special segments of DNA called <strong>transposons</strong> (<strong>jumping genes</strong>).</p>",

Therefore the mainstay of treatment in this disease is to increase dopamine in this area.</p>\n<p>Important drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Levodopa</strong> is a prodrug. It crosses the blood-brain barrier.&nbsp;In the brain, <strong>levodopa</strong> is converted to <strong>dopamine</strong> by decarboxylation in dopaminergic neurons in the striatum.</p>\n<p>Levodopa therapy significantly improves the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease. But the major problem with levodopa is the <strong>wearing-off phenomenon</strong>. Each dose of levodopa improves the symptoms for a period of 1&ndash;2 h, but rigidity and akinesia return rapidly after the effect of the drug reduces. Increasing the dose and frequency of administration can improve this situation, but the patients often develop dyskinesias, excessive and abnormal involuntary movements. In the later stages of the disease, patients may fluctuate rapidly between being &ldquo;off,&rdquo; having no beneficial effects from their medications, and being &ldquo;on&rdquo; having some beneficial effects but along with side effects.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Carbidopa-</strong> is a <strong>peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor</strong>. Levodopa if administered alone will undergo decarboxylation by the decarboxylases present in the intestinal mucosa and other peripheral sites. This will lead to decreased concentration of the drug reaching the brain. In order to prevent this levodopa is always given with carbidopa.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors</strong>- The addition of carbidopa to the levodopa prevents the peripheral decarboxylation of the drug. However, levodopa can now be <strong>methylated</strong> by catechol-O-methyl transferases and inactivate it. This is prevented by COMT inhibitors <strong>tolcapone and entacapone.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>4. Selective <strong>monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors-</strong> Dopamine in the striatum is predominantly metabolized by the MAO-B enzyme. Inhibiting this enzyme will <strong>increase</strong> the <strong>dopamine concentrations</strong> in these neurons. Eg.&nbsp;<strong>selegiline and rasagiline.</strong></p>\n<p>5. <strong>Dopamine receptor agonists</strong>- They act at the dopamine receptors and help in the improvement of the symptoms. <strong>Rotigotine</strong> acts on D1 and D2 receptors, whereas <strong>ropinirole</strong> and <strong>pramipexole</strong> both act on the D2 and D3 receptors. <strong>Apomorphine</strong> acts on D4 and mildly on D2, D3, and D5 receptors. It also has adrenergic action.</p>\n<p>6. <strong>Muscarinic receptor antagonists</strong>- these are used as adjuncts to dopamine therapy. Eg.&nbsp;<strong>trihexyphenidyl and benztropine</strong>. <strong>Diphenhydramine,</strong> an antihistamine is also used.</p>\n<p>7. <strong>Amantadine</strong> is an antiviral agent used for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A. It has antiparkinsonian activity.&nbsp;It alters dopamine release in the striatum, has anticholinergic properties, and <strong>blocks</strong>-methyl-D-aspartate (<strong>NMDA) receptors</strong>. It can be used in <strong>mild diseases</strong>.</p>",

This shift induces autonomic responses. It is characterized by more GI and fewer cardiovascular effects.&nbsp;It appears to be secondary to the release of several humoral agents, such as serotonin, bradykinin-like substances, neurotensin, and entero- glucagon.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Late dumping syndrome</strong> is due to the high carbohydrate load in the small intestine, which causes an increase in insulin levels and secondary hypoglycemia. This hypoglycemia activates the adrenal gland to release catecholamines, which results in diaphoresis, tremulousness, light-headedness, tachycardia, and confusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dietary manipulation is the mainstay of treatment of early dumping syndrome.
