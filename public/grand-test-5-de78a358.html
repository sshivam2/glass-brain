Borreliae are abundant in the patient's blood during this period. Fever subsides in 3-5 days.&nbsp;After an afebrile period of&nbsp;4-10 days,&nbsp;another bout of fever sets in.&nbsp;The&nbsp;borreliae reappear in blood during the relapses of&nbsp;fever.

This space is <strong>non-distensible</strong> so fluid can compress the heart and impair contraction leading to <strong>decreased cardiac output</strong>. It also obstructs venous return which further reduces filling.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Cardiac tamponade</strong>&nbsp;is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space.

It must be done under general anesthesia.&nbsp;This is the<strong> definitive management</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Chest tube insertion</strong> is used in massive <strong>hemothorax.</strong> Here, the accumulation of blood in the cavity severely restricts lung movements leading to inadequate ventilation. An appropriately placed chest tube can rapidly drain large amounts of blood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Analgesia</strong> is administered in cases of<strong> flail chest</strong>. This is because the pain from the rib fractures will further compromise respiratory movements. This patient's chest movements are normal.

This leads to the formation of<strong> urine </strong>with<strong> pH &gt; 5.5.</strong>\u00a0The decreased H<sup>+</sup> secretion also leads to <strong>inadequate HCO<sup>3-</sup> regeneration</strong> in the\u00a0alpha-intercalated cells thus leading to <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>. As <strong>H<sup>+</sup> </strong>is<strong> usually exchanged </strong>with<strong> K<sup>+</sup></strong> from the lumen in the DCT, <strong>decreased H<sup>+</sup> secretion</strong> is also associated with <strong>decreased K<sup>+</sup> absorption</strong>, resulting in <strong>hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Acidosis</strong> reduces net <strong>proximal fluid reabsorption</strong>, which leads to <strong>volume contraction</strong> and <strong>activation </strong>of the<strong> renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system</strong> (RAAS). This results in <strong>decreased proximal tubular Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption</strong> and increased distal delivery of Na<sup>+</sup> to the cortical collecting duct. These processes, along with increased aldosterone secretion, leading to increased K<sup>+</sup> secretion by activation of ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) channels in the collecting duct thus causing <strong>hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ammonium</strong> produced as a result of glutamine metabolism is <strong>secreted in the proximal tubule</strong>, which <strong>normally combines with H<sup>+</sup> ions</strong> secreted in the alpha-intercalated cells of the distal tubule to form NH4<sup>+</sup> ions. Since this process is impaired in RTA-1, the <strong>urine anion gap (UAG) is positive</strong> due to <strong>low urine NH4<sup>+\u00a0</sup>concentration</strong>. RTA-1 is associated with <strong>hypercalciuria</strong> and with persistent alkaline urine it is a risk factor for developing <strong>calcium phosphate stones</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>Renal tubular acidosis - type 2</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>proximal RTA</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>occurs due to generalized <strong>proximal tubule dysfunction</strong>.

There is no defect in the urine concentrating mechanism at the\u00a0cortical collecting tubule, thus\u00a0urine NH4<sup>+\u00a0</sup>concentration is normal and <strong>UAG </strong>is<strong> negative</strong>. There is no associated hypercalciuria.</p>\n<p>Option C-\u00a0<strong>Renal tubular acidosis - type 4\u00a0</strong>also known as <strong>pseudohypoaldosteronism\u00a0</strong>occurs due to end-organ resistance to aldosterone and is characterized by <strong>hyperkalemia</strong>, metabolic acidosis, and a <strong>positive UAG.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Alport syndrome</strong> is caused by mutations affecting <strong>type IV collagen</strong> that result in <strong>hematuria</strong> with progression to chronic renal failure, sensorineural deafness, and various eye disorders, including lens dislocation, posterior cataracts, and corneal dystrophy.</p>",

These proteins limit the escape of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The death-receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death receptors are surface molecules that are members of the<strong>&nbsp;tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family</strong>&nbsp;like the&nbsp;<strong>TNF 1</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Fas (CD 95).</strong></li>\n<li>These receptors are expressed on the surface of many cells and can trigger apoptosis. In the cytoplasmic region, these receptors have a death domain.</li>\n<li><strong>Fas ligand (FasL)</strong>&nbsp;is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T-lymphocytes. <strong>Fas-FasL</strong> interactions are required for thymic medullary negative selection. Defective interactions also cause <strong>autoimmune</strong> <strong>lymphoproliferative</strong> <strong>syndrome</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When these T-cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL, their cytoplasmic death domains form a binding site for an adaptor protein called&nbsp;Fas-associated death domain (<strong>FADD</strong>).</li>\n<li>These,&nbsp;in turn, recruit and activate&nbsp;<strong>caspase-8 and -10</strong>.</li>\n<li>In many cell types, caspase-8 and -10 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called&nbsp;<strong>Bid</strong>, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway.</li>\n<li>The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell.</li>\n<li>Cellular proteins, notably, a caspase antagonist called&nbsp;<strong>FLIP</strong>, block the activation of caspases downstream of the death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologs of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive.</li>\n<li>The death receptor pathway is involved in the&nbsp;elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes and in the killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following image shows a diagrammatic representation of the mechanisms of apoptosis:&nbsp;</p>",

It occurs due to infection with <strong>parainfluenza</strong> <strong>viruses</strong> <strong>commonly</strong>, but it may also be caused by influenza viruses type A or B, respiratory syncytial virus, or rhinovirus. Children aged <strong>6 months to 3 years</strong> are commonly affected. Infection results in subglottic and tracheal swelling causing stridor and other signs of respiratory obstruction.</p>\n<p>In infants and young children, the upper and lower airways are small, prone to occlusion by secretions, and susceptible to edema and swelling. As a result, the resistance to laminar airflow increases in inverse proportion to the fourth power of the radius (<strong>Poiseuille's law</strong>). Therefore, a small decrease in the radius of the airway results in a marked increase in resistance to airflow and the work of breathing. Children are more reliant on the diaphragm for inspiration, due to the relative immaturity of the intercostal muscles and accessory muscles.</p>\n<p>Treatment includes <strong>humidification </strong>of<strong> respiratory gases, oxygen, steroids, </strong>and<strong> nebulized epinephrine</strong>.&nbsp;Steroids reduce symptoms and improve croup scores 6&ndash;24 h after initial dosing, thereby reducing the need for intubation or shortening the time to extubation.</p>\n<p>Severe respiratory obstruction, as indicated by a persistently high croup score of &gt;7, despite ongoing medical treatment, is an indication for tracheal intubation.

It can be elicited on passive stretching of the muscles.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paresthesia&nbsp;</strong>occurs&nbsp;due to the&nbsp;<strong>compression of nerves</strong>&nbsp;in the compartment and indicates nerve ischemia.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pallor&nbsp;</strong>occurs due to&nbsp;<strong>ischemia</strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paralysis&nbsp;</strong>of muscle groups in the compartment is a&nbsp;<strong>late sign</strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pulselessness </strong>is usually not seen in the early stages unless there is a <strong>major arterial injury</strong>. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The injuries that are at high risk of developing acute compartment syndrome are the fractures of the&nbsp;<strong>elbow, forearm, proximal third of the tibia</strong>, and multiple fractures of the hand and foot. Other high-risk injuries are crush injuries and circumferential burns.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>intra-compartmental pressure</strong>&nbsp;(ICP) is measured using a <strong>split catheter</strong> introduced into the compartment. Earlier, the ICP values alone were used to determine the critical threshold for compartment syndrome. However, it was noted that different individuals had different levels of tolerance for raised ICP. Therefore, differential pressure is used now to determine the need for decompression.</p>\n<p><strong>Differential pressure (&Delta;P)</strong> is the&nbsp;difference between <strong>diastolic pressure</strong> and <strong>compartment pressure</strong>. When the&nbsp;<strong>&Delta;P&nbsp;</strong>is&nbsp;<strong>less than&nbsp;30 mm Hg</strong>, the perfusion from blood vessels to the tissues is impaired.

It is frequently used in <strong>lower segment cesarean sections</strong> to allow visualization of the lower uterine segment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Morris retractor</strong> is a large retractor used to give <strong>maximum exposure</strong> during&nbsp;<strong>abdominal surgeries</strong>. Because of its size, it can be used to improve the field of visibility by retracting a large number of structures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Czerny retractor&nbsp;</strong>has two ends. One end is a blade with a lip and the other has two prongs and is used to retract the ends of an incision. It is used to retract wounds like in open appendicectomy.</p>",
