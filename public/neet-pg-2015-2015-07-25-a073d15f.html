Standard prenatal screening protocols primarily target trisomies 21, 18, and 13, as well as Turner's syndrome. The highly effective first trimester combined screening (nuchal translucency with serum markers \u03b2-hCG and PAPP-A) and cell-free DNA testing are designed to detect these specific conditions.

The detection rate is extremely high - 99% with cell-free DNA testing and 85-92% with combined first trimester screening.

This condition commonly occurs with placenta succenturiata, where a smaller accessory lobe is separated from the main placental mass. The vessels connecting the main placenta to the succenturiate lobe must traverse the membranes, placing them at risk of compression or rupture. If these vessels run over the cervical os in front of the presenting part, vasa previa occurs.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A.

The Lyon hypothesis (X-chromosome inactivation) actually explains why some heterozygous females can be affected by G6PD deficiency, though typically less severely than males. During early embryonic development, one X chromosome in each female cell is randomly inactivated. If a higher proportion of cells have the normal X chromosome inactivated, these females can express symptoms of G6PD deficiency.

This happens in severe cases of ulcerative colitis, particularly when there is extensive colonic involvement (pancolitis).

However, at high rates of stimulation (20-50 Hz) or following brief exercise, an incremental response occurs, which is characteristic of LEMS. This distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis.

This interaction represents T cell-dependent activation of B cells. Protein antigens are processed by B cells and presented as peptide fragments complexed with MHC class II molecules to helper T cells. Once these complexes are recognized by Th cells, they secrete cytokines and express CD40 ligand which interacts with CD40 on B cells. This T-B interaction and the cytokines provide the essential signals for B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Strangulation</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Fracture of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage with neck muscle bruising are classic findings in cases of strangulation. In strangulation, direct pressure is applied circumferentially to the neck, causing compression of vital neck structures. The external force applied during strangulation typically causes these specific fractures along with surrounding soft tissue injuries due to the significant pressure applied directly against these anatomical structures.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Option B. Hanging</strong> - While hanging can also cause hyoid bone fractures, it typically produces a different pattern of injury compared to strangulation. In hanging, the pressure is applied from the suspension point upward, creating an inverted V-shaped mark (furrow) that is incomplete posteriorly, with less common hyoid fractures particularly in partial suspension. The combination of both hyoid and thyroid cartilage fractures with muscle bruising is more characteristic of strangulation than hanging.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Option C. Choking</strong> - Choking refers to internal obstruction of the airways by a foreign body or material, not external compression of the neck.

By the 4th-5th day, the bruise appears bluish-black to brown as hemosiderin (an iron-storage complex) forms. Around the 5th-6th day, the bruise turns green due to the formation of biliverdin (a green pigment formed during hemoglobin breakdown).

When extracellular K+ increases (hyperkalemia), the concentration gradient for K+ decreases, reducing K+ efflux from the cell. This causes the resting membrane potential to move closer to the threshold potential, making the neuron more excitable. In mild to moderate hyperkalemia, this decreased gradient leads to K+ accumulation inside cells, causing depolarization and increased excitability.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Decreasing extracellular Na+</strong> Decreasing extracellular Na+ primarily reduces the frequency of the action potential but has minimal effect on the resting membrane potential.

Increasing extracellular Na+</strong> The permeability of the membrane to Na+ at rest is relatively low, so increasing extracellular Na+ has little effect on the resting membrane potential or excitability. The RMP is primarily determined by K+ gradient since K+ has much higher permeability at rest.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Increasing extracellular Cl-</strong> Increasing extracellular Cl- would push the membrane potential more negative (hyperpolarization) since Cl- influx has a hyperpolarizing effect.

This differs from the venous drainage pattern of the left suprarenal gland, which drains into the left renal vein.

Adduction of the thumb</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In ulnar nerve injury at the wrist (low ulnar nerve palsy), there is paralysis of adduction of the thumb. This occurs because the adductor pollicis muscle is supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve in the hand.

Lactose intolerance is characterized by the inability to digest lactose (milk sugar) due to deficiency of the enzyme lactase. When undigested lactose reaches the colon, it gets fermented by colonic bacteria, producing gas and causing symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and watery diarrhea. Steatorrhea, however, is a feature of fat malabsorption disorders like pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease, or bile acid deficiency, not lactose intolerance.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Among these manifestations, sensorineural deafness is the most common and prevalent defect, affecting approximately 80% of infants with CRS. The hearing impairment is typically bilateral and can range from mild to profound.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The classic triad of CRS includes:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Sensorineural deafness (most common)</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Eye abnormalities (cataracts, microphthalmia, glaucoma)</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cardiac defects (most commonly PDA)</span></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The risk of defects is highest when maternal infection occurs during the first trimester, particularly before 11 weeks of gestation, when the risk of defects is approximately 90%.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Heart defect - Incorrect</strong>. Cardiac defects (particularly PDA, followed by peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis) occur in about 50-60% of CRS cases, making them less prevalent than deafness.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

Aspergillus is a common cause of opportunistic pulmonary infections in immunocompromised children, especially those with prolonged neutropenia, chronic granulomatous disease, or those on long-term corticosteroid therapy. It can cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and aspergilloma.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Cryptococcus - Incorrect</strong>. Cryptococcus (particularly C. neoformans) is a significant cause of pulmonary and central nervous system infections in immunocompromised children, especially those with HIV/AIDS or on immunosuppressive therapy. Pulmonary cryptococcosis is more common than pulmonary sporotrichosis.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Mucor - Incorrect</strong>. Mucor species (causing mucormycosis) are increasingly recognized as important opportunistic fungi in immunocompromised children, particularly those with diabetic ketoacidosis, prolonged neutropenia, or those receiving deferoxamine therapy. Rhinocerebral and pulmonary mucormycosis are the most common clinical presentations.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Sporothrix schenckii primarily causes cutaneous sporotrichosis following traumatic inoculation and is rarely associated with pulmonary infections in children, unlike Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Mucor species, which are more common opportunistic pulmonary pathogens in immunocompromised pediatric patients.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Picture1_nKi2jvC.png\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

    "solution": "<p><strong>Correct Answer: A. Adrenaline</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Dale's vasomotor reversal phenomenon refers to the reversal of adrenaline's pressor (blood pressure elevating) effect to a depressor effect when \u03b1-adrenergic receptors are blocked. This occurs specifically with adrenaline because it has significant activity on both \u03b1 receptors (vasoconstriction) and \u03b2\u2082 receptors (vasodilation). When \u03b1 receptors are blocked by drugs like phentolamine, adrenaline produces only vasodilation through its \u03b2\u2082 action, resulting in a fall in blood pressure rather than a rise.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><strong>Option B. Noradrenaline:</strong> Noradrenaline acts primarily on \u03b1\u2081, \u03b1\u2082, and \u03b2\u2081 receptors with minimal \u03b2\u2082 activity. Without significant \u03b2\u2082 vasodilator effects, it cannot demonstrate the reversal phenomenon when \u03b1 receptors are blocked.</li><li><strong>Option C. Isoprenaline:</strong> Isoprenaline is a pure \u03b2-receptor agonist (\u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082) with negligible \u03b1 activity. It naturally causes vasodilation and hypotension, so blocking \u03b1 receptors wouldn't reverse its effect.</li><li><strong>Option D. Both adrenaline and noradrenaline:</strong> While both are catecholamines, only adrenaline shows the vasomotor reversal phenomenon due to its balanced \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2082 receptor activity.\u00a0</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Dale's vasomotor reversal phenomenon occurs specifically with adrenaline when \u03b1-adrenergic blockade unmasks its \u03b2\u2082-mediated vasodilator effects, converting its normal pressor response to a depressor effect.</p>",

This gene encodes the catalase-peroxidase enzyme that converts INH from its prodrug form to its active metabolite. Mutations in katG prevent this activation, rendering INH ineffective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Mutations in pncA are responsible for resistance to pyrazinamide, not isoniazid.</li><li><strong>Option D. gyrA \u2013 gyrB genes</strong>: These genes encode DNA gyrase subunits and are associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin.
