The initial therapy is <strong>high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIg).</strong></p>\n<p>GBS is an acute&nbsp;autoimmune&nbsp;neuropathy. It results from the <strong>autoimmune destruction</strong> of nerves in the <strong>peripheral nervous</strong> <strong>system</strong> causing <strong>weakness</strong> that can progress to paralysis. It is associated with <em><strong>Campylobacter jejuni</strong></em> gastrointestinal infections, vaccines and respiratory illnesses. The antibodies target peripheral nerves and cause demylenation. Hence the preferred treatment is to neutralize these autoantibodies using<strong> IVIg (I.V. immunoglobulins) or plasmapheresis.&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">IVIg is often the initial therapy chosen because of its ease of administration and good safety record.</span></p>\n<p>IVIg is also preferred over plasma exchange (PE) for the AMAN and MFS variants of GBS.</p>\n<p>GBS manifests as a rapidly evolving<strong>&nbsp;motor paralysis</strong>&nbsp;with areflexia (or hyporeflexia), with or without sensory disturbance. It is an ascending paralysis that affects the lower limbs more than the upper limbs. <strong>Areflexia or hyporeflexia</strong> is usually present. It can also affect the <strong>cranial nerves</strong>, leading to features of<strong> bulbar paralysis</strong> like difficulty<strong> articulating words</strong> and <strong>excessive drooling</strong>. Respiration is compromised when it involves <strong>respiratory muscles</strong>. In such cases, ventilatory support is needed.</p>\n<p>Note:&nbsp;Steroid therapy is used in <strong>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy&nbsp;</strong>and not useful in GBS. Physostigmine is used to treat mysthenia gravis which present initially with occular symptoms like ptosis and diplopia.</p>",
