When there is a spasm of the muscles, the stronger flexors pull the hip in flexion. <strong>Soft tissue contractures</strong> can convert this into a <strong>fixed flexion deformity</strong>, making locomotion impossible.&nbsp;<em><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Steps of Thomas test:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\">Positioning: The patient is instructed to lie supine on a hard surface with their legs fully extended.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">Observing lumbar lordosis: As the patient assumes the supine position, the curvature of the <strong>lower back is visually assessed for any exaggerated lumbar lordosis</strong>. It is noted that excessive lumbar lordosis may be a compensatory response to a flexion deformity.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Gradual flexion of the normal hip</strong>: The normal hip is gradually flexed, with care taken not to exceed its normal range of motion.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Monitoring for overcorrection</strong>: During the flexion of the normal hip, signs of overcorrection on the normal side are observed, such as the pelvis starting to lift off the ground. To prevent this,<strong> both ischial tuberosities are ensured to remain in contact with the surface.</strong></li>\n<li class=\"p1\">Automatic positioning of the affected hip: As a result of the flexion of the normal hip, the affected hip automatically assumes the deformed position characterized by flexion.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">Measuring the degree of flexion: Once the affected hip is in the flexed position, the <strong>angle formed between the affected thigh and the bed is measured</strong>.

Hodgkin lymphoma arises in a single node or chain of nodes and spreads first to anatomically contiguous lymphoid tissues. The <strong>extranodal</strong> presentation is <strong>rare</strong>.

They are specialized substrate analogs that contain a chemical group that reacts with the catalytic machinery of the target enzyme. In these types of inhibitors, the substrate analog <strong>irreversibly</strong> ties up with the binding site of an enzyme, deceiving the enzyme by concealing its functional group resulting in the formation of a <strong>highly reactive molecule</strong>, which brings about <strong>self-inactivation</strong> of the enzyme.</p>\n<p>Suicide inhibitors bind to the enzyme by means of <strong>covalent bonds</strong>; they are <strong>enzyme-specific</strong> and unreactive outside the confines of the enzyme&rsquo;s active site.</p>\n<p>An example of this would be the binding of <strong>clavulanic acid</strong> to the active site of <strong>beta-lactamases</strong> in bacteria. Clavulanic acid mimics the structure of a beta-lactam antibiotic&nbsp;and forms a covalent adduct with the &beta;-lactamase active site. This leads to a rearrangement that creates a much more reactive derivative, which is subsequently attacked in its active site to irreversibly acylate the enzyme and inactivate it. Thus, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid are combined to overcome bacterial resistance to amoxicillin alone.</p>\n<p>The development of clavulanic acid to target beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is also an example of the <strong>rational design</strong> of drugs. Rational design of drugs refers to the ability to predict the appropriate molecular structure of a drug on the basis of information about its biological receptor.</p>",

This also&nbsp;contributes to resistance to loop diuretics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Normally<strong>, aldosterone</strong> (<strong>AL</strong>) enters the cells of the <strong>late distal tubule</strong> and <strong>collecting ducts</strong> by diffusion and binds to a specific <strong>mineralocorticoid receptor</strong> (<strong>MR</strong>) in the cytoplasm. This AL-MR complex mediates Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption, which drives the secretion of K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>into the tubules.</p>\n<p>Eplerenone <strong>competitively blocks</strong>&nbsp;this<strong> MR</strong>, preventing it from binding with aldosterone. The net effect is&nbsp;<strong>sodium diuresis</strong> and <strong>potassium retention</strong>. It is a potassium-sparing diuretic. Other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists include&nbsp;<strong>spironolactone</strong>, <strong>canrenone</strong>, <strong>potassium canrenoate</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some clinical uses of MR antagonists are -&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hypertension due to primary hyperaldosteronism&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Edema associated with liver cirrhosis, congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease</li>\n<li>They may reduce mortality in patients with myocardial infarction</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hyperkalemia</strong> is the major side effect of MR antagonists, the risk being greater in patients with <strong>renal disease</strong> or those already <strong>taking ACE inhibitors</strong>. Other important side effects are <strong>gynecomastia</strong> and <strong>decreased libido</strong> due to the&nbsp;<strong>anti-androgenic effect</strong> of spironolactone but eplerenone does not cause gynecomastia and decreased libido.</p>\n<p>Other options :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A-&nbsp;<strong>Triamterene</strong>&nbsp;directly <strong>inhibits</strong> renal <strong>epithelial</strong> <strong>sodium channels </strong>(ENaC) in the <strong>late distal tubule</strong> and <strong>collecting duct.</strong>&nbsp;It is a potassium-sparing diuretic and is generally used along with other diuretics in the treatment of hypertension and edema. Triamterene is metabolized in the liver, hence triamterene toxicity may be enhanced in patients with hepatic disease. It is used in the management of <strong>Liddle syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C-&nbsp;<strong>Chlorthalidone </strong>is a thiazide-like diuretic. It<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<strong>inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> symporter</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>early distal tubule</strong> and increases the excretion of sodium and chloride.&nbsp;</span></span>Thiazide diuretics may be used for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, nephrolithiasis due to idiopathic hypercalciuria, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.</p>\n<p>Option D-<strong> Furosemide</strong> is a <strong>loop diuretic</strong>. It acts by <strong>inhibiting</strong> the <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup></strong> symporter in the <strong>thick ascending limb</strong> of the&nbsp;<strong>loop</strong> <strong>of Henle</strong> resulting in increased excretion of sodium and chloride. It also has mild carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity and also increases urinary excretion of bicarbonate and phosphate. Cirrhotic patients are often resistant to loop diuretics due to&nbsp;<strong>decreased secretion</strong> of the drug into <strong>tubular fluid</strong> and high aldosterone levels. Furosemide may be given along with eplerenone, but the best answer here is eplerenone since <strong>aldosterone antagonists</strong> are the <strong>main therapy</strong> for cirrhotic edema.</p>",

It <strong>blocks</strong> &alpha;-4, &beta;-2 <strong>nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</strong> subtypes and varenicline <strong>inhibits dopaminergic activation</strong> produced by smoking through their <strong>partial agonism</strong>, and decreases the craving and withdrawal syndrome that occurs with cessation attempts. It prevents nicotine stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system associated with nicotine addiction, thus helping to occlude the \"rewarding\" effect of smoking.</p>\n<p>Varenicline is prescribed only to patients 18 years or older. Varenicline is taken orally and the dose taken is 0.5 mg once daily on days 1 to 3, increased to 0.5 mg twice daily on days 4 through 7 and 1 mg twice daily after day 8 for 11 weeks. Therapy should start one week before the target quit date. It can be continued for another 12 weeks (1 mg BD) to maintain abstinence.</p>\n<p>The adverse effects include nausea, which can be mitigated by starting at lower doses and gradually increasing the dose. Other symptoms include disturbed sleep, sleepwalking, agitation, drowsiness, and constipation and&nbsp;may also increase the risk of pancreatitis. Varenicline has also been implicated in specific skin syndromes such as <strong>Stevens-Johnson&nbsp;syndrome</strong>, erythema multiforme, and photosensitivity. Varenicline can cause renal failure and kidney stones, thus renal function must be monitored.</p>\n<p>The FDA has issued a warning about <strong>mood</strong> and <strong>behavioral changes</strong> associated with its use, and there is some evidence of <strong>increased cardiovascular risk.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Buspirone </strong>sustained release&nbsp;is a <strong>partial agonist</strong> at<strong> 5HT</strong> receptors but affinity for D<sub>2</sub> receptors may also be present.

In xenodiagnosis, the <strong>vector</strong> of a pathogenic agent is infected and the pathogen is allowed to multiply in the vector. Vectors are insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, mites, flies, fleas, and lice that transmit infections and they act as the '<strong>foreign host.'</strong> Later, the vector is examined for the presence of the pathogen.</p>\n<p>For example,<strong> diagnosis of Chagas disease:</strong>&nbsp;Laboratory bred Reduviid bugs (vector/ foreign host) are allowed to feed on the suspected patients (original host).

However, the contribution by the smallest airways is very little to the overall total resistance. This is because, the airway branches in each generation exist in <strong>parallel</strong> rather than in series. As the parallel branching increases, the resistance decreases. (<strong>Total</strong> cross-sectional diameter of small airways put together is high). Thus the overall resistance of the small airways is very small. Also,&nbsp;airflow velocity decreases substantially as the effective cross-sectional area increases (i.e., the flow becomes laminar).</p>\n<p>Other factors affecting airway resistance :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lung volume</strong>, as lung volume increases the resistance decreases and vice versa. Lung volume increases the transairway pressure thus increasing the caliber of the airway.</li>\n<li><strong>Airway mucus, edema</strong>, and <strong>contraction</strong> of bronchial smooth muscle increase the airway resistance.

A garlicky odor of breath and feces may be noted</li>\n<li>Renal: Oliguria, uremia, albuminuria, red cell casts.</li>\n<li>Cardiovascular system: Acute circulatory collapse with vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillation.</li>\n<li>Central nervous system: Headache, vertigo, hyperthermia, convulsions, coma. Peripheral neuropathy is more sensory than motor.</li>\n<li>Death is usually due to circulatory failure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Fulminant type</strong>: Massive doses of arsenic when rapidly absorbed cause death in one to three hours. Death occurs due to shock and peripheral vascular failure. Arsenic also has a direct action on the heart muscle. In this type gastrointestinal symptoms are absent.</li>\n<li><strong>Narcotic type</strong>: The gastrointestinal symptoms are minimal. There is giddiness, formication, delirium. Arseniuretted hydrogen when inhaled as a gas, destroys hemoglobin and causes hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and renal failure. Death is instantaneous.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repeated stomach washes with&nbsp;warm water and milk.</li>\n<li>Emetics should not be used</li>\n<li>Oral hydrated ferric oxide is given in small doses.

Other symptoms include&nbsp;muscle and joint pain, convulsions, optic neuritis, delirium. Loss of the <strong>outer third of eyebrows</strong> is significant. Maculo-papular butterfly-shaped skin eruption on the face is characteristic. There may be <strong>Mees lines</strong> on the nails.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Acute</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Lead poisoning</strong>&nbsp;causes dry throat, burning abdominal pain, peripheral circulatory collapse, insomnia, paraesthesias, depression, coma, and death.
