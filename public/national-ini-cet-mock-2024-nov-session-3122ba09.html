Niacin can also result in <strong>hyperuricemia</strong> and may <strong>reactivate gout.</strong> Hence, a history of <strong>gout</strong> is a <strong>relative contraindication</strong> for niacin.</p>\n<p><strong>Niacin</strong> is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin and is the only vitamin that affects that lipid levels. Niacin acts by <strong>inhibiting</strong> the <strong>lipolysis</strong> of triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase in the adipose tissue. Niacin reduces the free fatty acid transport to the liver and decreases triglyceride synthesis by inhibiting both the synthesis and esterification of fatty acids. There is also a <strong>reduction</strong> of <strong>very-low-density lipoprotein</strong> (VLDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by decreasing their productivity and enhancing their clearance. <strong>High-density</strong> lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are <strong>raised</strong> due to the decreased clearance of apo A-1 in HDL.</p>\n<p>The indications of niacin are <strong>hypertriglyceridemia</strong> and <strong>elevated LDL cholesterol.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>most common </strong>serious side effect of niacin is <strong>hepatotoxicity</strong>. Other\u00a0adverse effects of niacin include\u00a0<strong>dyspepsia</strong>, <strong>cutaneous</strong>\u00a0<strong>flushing, and pruritus. </strong>Flushing\u00a0and pruritus\u00a0can be controlled<strong>\u00a0</strong>with aspirin as they are prostaglandin mediated. Concurrent use of niacin with a statin can result in myopathy. Niacin is avoided in pregnant females as it resulted in birth defects in experimental animals.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options A and B- <strong>Cholestyramine</strong> and <strong>colestipol</strong> are bile acid sequestrants. These are highly positively charged and bind to negatively charged bile acids resulting in their excretion in the stool. Hepatic cholesterol content reduces due to the increased bile acid synthesis. This increases the LDL receptors in the liver resulting in increased LDL cholesterol clearance. These agents are relatively safe but <strong>severe hypertriglyceridemia</strong> is a <strong>contraindication</strong> to its use as these agents increase the triglyceride levels.</p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>Clofibrate</strong> is a halogenated fibric acid derivative. Fibrates bind to PPAR-\u03b1 and reduce triglycerides through PPAR-\u03b1 mediated stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, increased lipoprotein lipase synthesis, and reduced expression of apo C-III. The adverse effects include rash, urticaria, hair loss, myalgias, fatigue, headache, and impotence. Clofibrate can result in myopathy and gall stone formation. Fibrates should not be used in children or pregnant women. <strong>Renal failure</strong> and <strong>hepatic dysfunction</strong> are <strong>relative contraindications</strong> to the use of fibrates.</p>",

This process is initiated by&nbsp;<strong>caspase 9&nbsp;</strong>(Intrinsic pathway) and&nbsp;<strong>caspase 8&nbsp;</strong>(Extrinsic pathway). (Remember:&nbsp;Caspase&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>ight (8) =&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xtrinsic pathway)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Councilman's bodies are <strong>acidophil</strong> bodies, which represent hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis. They&nbsp;are seen mainly in <strong>acute viral hepatitis</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Apoptosis</strong> is a pathway of cell death that is induced by a closely regulated suicide program in which cells destined to die, activate intrinsic enzymes that degrade the cells nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism of apoptosis:&nbsp;</strong>There are two distinct pathways that can lead to caspase activation and cause apoptosis of the cell.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway</li>\n<li>The death receptor or extrinsic pathway</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are several proteins in the mitochondria that can induce apoptosis. These include&nbsp;<strong>cytochrome c</strong>&nbsp;and some proteins that neutralize the endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis.</li>\n<li>The permeability of the mitochondria is controlled by a family of proteins called the BCL 2 family, which act as sensors.</li>\n<li>These sensors are activated when the cells are deprived of growth factors and other survival signals, are exposed to agents that damage the DNA, or accumulate a large number of misfolded proteins.</li>\n<li>These activated sensors,&nbsp;in turn, activate the&nbsp;<strong>proapoptotic molecules</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>BAX</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>BAK</strong>, which form channels in the mitochondrial membrane, through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol and cause activation of&nbsp;<strong>caspase-9</strong>, which in turn leads to the activation of the caspase cascade and, eventually, apoptosis of the cell.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, if all the growth factors and other survival signals are present, then they produce more&nbsp;<strong>antiapoptotic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>members</strong>&nbsp;of the BH1-4 family like the&nbsp;<strong>BCL2, MCL 1</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>BCL</strong>-<strong>XL</strong>. These proteins limit the escape of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The death-receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death receptors are surface molecules that are members of the<strong>&nbsp;tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family</strong>&nbsp;like the&nbsp;<strong>TNF 1</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Fas (CD 95).</strong></li>\n<li>These receptors are expressed on the surface of many cells and can trigger apoptosis. In the cytoplasmic region, these receptors have a &ldquo;death domain.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><strong>Fas ligand (FasL)</strong>&nbsp;is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T-lymphocytes. Fas-FasL interactions are required for thymic medullary negative selection. Defective interactions also cause the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When these T-cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL and bind adaptor proteins via the death domain.</li>\n<li>These,&nbsp;in turn, recruit and activate&nbsp;<strong>caspase-8 and caspase-10</strong>.</li>\n<li>In many cell types, caspase-8 and caspase-10 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called&nbsp;<strong>Bid</strong>, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway.</li>\n<li>The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell.</li>\n<li>Cellular proteins, notably, a caspase antagonist called&nbsp;<strong>FLIP</strong>, block the activation of caspases downstream of the death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologues of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive.</li>\n<li>The death receptor pathway is involved in the&nbsp;elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes and in the killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.</li>\n</ul>",

There are 8 types of osteogenesis imperfecta. It occurs most commonly due to mutation in the<strong> COL1A</strong> and <strong>COL2A</strong> genes.

This results in the abnormal formation of type 1 collagen.</p>\n<p>The main features are joints that are vulnerable to <strong>fracture (joint laxity)</strong>, scleral alterations (blue sclera), <strong>dentinogenesis imperfecta</strong>, and <strong>deafness</strong>. Multiple bone fractures are a consequence of bone fragility. <strong>Bowing of the long bones</strong>, <strong>wormian bones</strong>, and<strong> multiple diaphyseal fractures</strong> of long bones with various stages are the common radiological findings that are observed. <strong>Management</strong> comprises the use of <strong>bisphosphonates</strong>, along with <strong>physiotherapy</strong> and <strong>walking aids</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Option A</strong>: \u00a0<strong>Formation of the</strong> <strong>covalent cross-links</strong> is seen in <strong>Menke disease</strong>.
