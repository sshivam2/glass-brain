It is <strong>lipophilic</strong> in nature.</p>\n<p>Fentanyl is preferred over morphine or oxycodone in rescue analgesia. It <strong>controls</strong> the <strong>pain more rapidly</strong> than <strong>morphine</strong>&nbsp;(option A) and also <strong>reduces</strong> the incidence of <strong>PONV</strong> i.e postoperative nausea and vomiting. While <strong>oxycodone</strong> (option C) has good analgesic action when given systemically for visceral pain relief, it has an&nbsp;<strong>increased incidence of adverse effects </strong>when compared to <strong>fentanyl.</strong> Hence, <strong>fentanyl</strong>&nbsp;is preferred over morphine and oxycodone for rescue analgesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other uses are: to manage pain before surgical procedures, supplement in balanced anesthesia, in combination with benzodiazepines in diagnostic, endoscopic, angiographic, and minor procedures, and as an adjuvant in spinal anesthesia.</p>\n<p>Hypertonia can often occur following a rapid infusion of fentanyl and hence a muscle relaxant is often supplemented. <strong>Respiratory depression</strong> is a common side effect. Other side effects include nausea, vomiting, and itching.</p>\n<p>Note: <strong>Codeine</strong> is a less potent opioid agonist. Oral codeine is useful to suppress cough but has mild to moderate analgesic properties. When given intravenously, it can cause profound hypotension, and hence it is not recommended.</p>",

These include <strong>beta-blockers</strong> or <strong>non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB)</strong> such as <strong>verapamil</strong> and <strong>diltiazem</strong>.

Positive P waves are seen in lead V1. Conduction of more than 230 impulses/ minute through the AV node is not possible in adults.
