These include&nbsp;<strong>cytochrome c</strong>&nbsp;and some proteins that neutralize the endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis.</li>\n<li>The permeability of the mitochondria is controlled by a family of proteins called the BCL-2 family, which act as sensors.</li>\n<li>These sensors are activated when the cells are deprived of growth factors and other survival signals, are exposed to agents that damage the DNA, or accumulate a large number of misfolded proteins.</li>\n<li>These activated sensors,&nbsp;in turn, activate the&nbsp;<strong>proapoptotic molecules</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>BAX</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>BAK</strong>, which form channels in the mitochondrial membrane, through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol and cause activation of&nbsp;<strong>caspase-9</strong>, which, in turn, leads to the activation of the caspase cascade and, eventually, apoptosis of the cell.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, if all the growth factors and other survival signals are present, then they produce more&nbsp;<strong>antiapoptotic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>members</strong>&nbsp;of the BH1-4 family like the&nbsp;<strong>BCL2, MCL 1</strong>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>BCL</strong>-<strong>XL</strong>. These proteins limit the escape of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The death-receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death receptors are surface molecules that are members of the<strong>&nbsp;tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family,</strong>&nbsp;like <strong>TNF 1</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Fas (CD 95).</strong></li>\n<li>These receptors are expressed on the surface of many cells and can trigger apoptosis. In the cytoplasmic region, these receptors have a &ldquo;death domain.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><strong>Fas ligand (FasL)</strong>&nbsp;is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T-lymphocytes. Fas-FasL interactions are required for thymic medullary negative selection. Defective interactions also cause the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When these T-cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL and bind adaptor proteins via the death domain.</li>\n<li>These,&nbsp;in turn, recruit and activate&nbsp;<strong>caspase-8 and -10</strong>.</li>\n<li>In many cell types, caspase-8 and -10 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called&nbsp;<strong>Bid</strong>, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway.</li>\n<li>The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell.</li>\n<li>Cellular proteins, notably, a caspase antagonist called&nbsp;<strong>FLIP</strong>, block the activation of caspases downstream of the death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologues of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive.</li>\n<li>The death receptor pathway is involved in the&nbsp;elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes and in the killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.</li>\n</ul>",

These features along with severe <strong>developmental delay</strong>, <strong>cloudy cornea</strong>, hepatomegaly, and<strong>\u00a0intellectual\u00a0disability</strong> suggest that the child has Hurler syndrome.</p>\n<p>It is a <strong>severe</strong> type of mucopolysaccharidoses <strong>(MPS) I</strong>. It is caused due to deficiency of\u00a0<strong>\u03b1-L-iduronidase. </strong>This enzyme is required for the breakdown of dermatan and heparan sulfate. The deficiency of the enzyme leads to the accumulation of these mucopolysaccharides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Patients usually present between <strong>6-24 months</strong> of age. They have</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intellectual disability</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Skeletal dysplasia,</strong>\u00a0called dysostosis multiplex- thick ribs, ovoid vertebral bodies,<strong> enlarged diaphyses</strong> of the long bones, macrocephaly, enlarged <strong>J-shaped sella</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Cloudy cornea</strong>, glaucoma, retinal degeneration</li>\n<li>Mixed hearing loss, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option A- The <strong>Scheie syndrome</strong>\u00a0is a milder form of MPS-I (MPS I-S ). The symptoms appear <strong>after 5 years</strong> of age and the diagnosis is made between 10-20 years. It is characterized by <strong>normal intelligence</strong> and stature, joint stiffness, aortic valve disease, corneal clouding, and mild dysostosis multiplex. Ophthalmic and cardiac involvement might be present.</p>\n<p>Option\u00a0B- <strong>Hurler-Scheie syndrome</strong> is an intermediate between Hurler syndrome and\u00a0Scheie syndrome. The onset of symptoms is between <strong>3-8 years of</strong> age. They have <strong>mild</strong> or <strong>no intellectual dysfunction</strong>.\u00a0Ophthalmic and cardiac involvement might be present.</p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Hunter syndrome</strong> is a <strong>type II MPS.\u00a0</strong>It occurs due to the deficiency of <strong>iduronate 2-sulfatase.\u00a0</strong>It shares the same features as type I MPS like coarse facial features, short stature, and dysostosis multiplex. However, there is <strong>no corneal clouding.\u00a0</strong>It is the only MPS with <strong>X-linked recessive</strong> inheritance. So if a\u00a0baby girl is affected in the family, it is less likely to be Hunter syndrome. All the other MPS are autosomal recessive.</p>",

It is completely or partially fermented by the gut bacteria to short-chain fatty acids (<strong>SCFA</strong>) in the large intestine.

The <strong>intensity</strong> of this click sound changes <strong>depending </strong>on the<strong> left ventricular (LV) volume</strong>. When LV <strong>volume increases</strong>, the floppy valve is able to maintain tension, and the degree of prolapse is reduced. Thus the <strong>intensity</strong> of the murmur <strong>reduces.</strong> On the other hand, when the LV <strong>volume is low</strong>, the mitral valve leaflets remain floppy and produce a <strong>louder click</strong> sound.</p>\n<p>By this logic, when the patient <strong>stands up</strong>, the venous return reduces and so the<strong>&nbsp;LV volume decrease. </strong>This causes the<strong> murmur</strong> to become <strong>louder.</strong> On<strong> lying down</strong>, venous return increases, leading to <strong>increased LV volume</strong> and a <strong>softer murmur</strong>.
