Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the <strong>same 2-week period.&nbsp;</strong>Atleast<strong> one of the symptoms</strong> is either <strong>depressed mood</strong> or <strong>loss of interest</strong> or pleasure.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Depressed mood most of the day</li>\n<li>Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities (anhedonia)</li>\n<li>Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, decrease or increase in appetite</li>\n<li>Insomnia or hypersomnia</li>\n<li>Psychomotor agitation or retardation</li>\n<li>Fatigue or loss of energy</li>\n<li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt</li>\n<li>Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness</li>\n<li>Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>B. The symptoms cause <strong>clinically significant distress</strong> or<strong> impairment</strong> in social, occupa&shy;tional, or other important areas <strong>of functioning.</strong></p>\n<p>C. The episode is <strong>not attributable to</strong> the physiological effects of<strong> a substance</strong> or to another medical condition.</p>\n<p>D. The occurrence of the major depressive episode <strong>is not better explained by</strong> schizoaf&shy;fective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified <strong>schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.</strong></p>\n<p>E. There has <strong>never been</strong> a <strong>manic</strong> episode or a <strong>hypomanic episode</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other Options:<br /><br />Option A: <strong>Conversion disorder</strong> is a condition with symptoms or deficits that involve&nbsp;<strong>voluntary motor</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>sensory functions</strong>. Though it points to an underlying medical condition, in reality, it arises due to&nbsp;<strong>psychological factors</strong>. The symptoms are&nbsp;<strong>not intentionally produced</strong>&nbsp;and the gain obtained is primarily psychological.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It can be associated with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and somatization disorders. Paralysis,&nbsp;<strong>blindness</strong>, and mutism are the most frequently seen conversion disorder symptoms. Anesthesia and paresthesia of the extremities, abnormal movements, and gait disturbance are the other features commonly seen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Somatic symptom disorder</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by the fear of having a serious illness based on the person's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. The symptoms are persistent for&nbsp;<strong>over 6 months.&nbsp;</strong>It equally affects men and women and is commonly seen in the&nbsp;<strong>third decade</strong>&nbsp;of life. It is associated with&nbsp;<strong>poor insight.</strong>&nbsp;Patients believe that they have a serious disease that has not yet been detected and they can&shy;not be persuaded otherwise. Their convictions persist despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and reassurances from doctors.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Dysthymic&nbsp;disorder&nbsp;</strong>is the presence of a <strong>persistently depressed mood</strong> that lasts most of the day and is continuous. There are also feelings of guilt, irritability, and anger associated with it. These symptoms are present for <strong>at least 2 years</strong>.&nbsp;It is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that patients mention that they have always been depressed. There will never be an episode of mania/hypomania in this condition.</p>",
