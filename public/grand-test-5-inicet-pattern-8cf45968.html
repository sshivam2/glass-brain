With continued deoxygenation HbS molecules assemble into long <strong>needle-like fibers </strong>within red cells, producing a <strong>distorted sickle</strong> <strong>or holly-leaf shape.&nbsp;</strong>Polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin, leading to red cell distortion<strong>, hemolytic anemia, microvascular obstruction, </strong>and ischemic tissue damage.</p>\n<p>Peripheral blood smear demonstrates -&nbsp; Irreversibly<strong> sickled cells</strong>, reticulocytosis, and target cells, which result from red cell dehydration with <strong>Howell-Jolly bodies.</strong></p>\n<p>The major pathologic manifestation is chronic hemolysis, microvascular occlusions, and tissue damage. Increased breakdown of hemoglobin is responsible for&nbsp;<strong>pigment gallstones and hyperbilirubinemia.&nbsp;</strong>Splenomegaly can be seen in early childhood, but&nbsp;fibrosis and progressive shrinkage of the spleen may occur in adolescence known as&nbsp;<strong>autosplenectomy.&nbsp;</strong>Priapism affects up to 45% of males. Leg ulcers may also be seen. Stroke and retinopathy leading to loss of visual acuity and even blindness.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaso-occlusive crises, or pain crises</strong>&nbsp;are characterized by episodes of hypoxic injury and infarction that cause severe pain in the affected region, hand-foot syndrome, or dactylitis.&nbsp;<strong>Osteomyelitis</strong>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;<strong>sickle cell anemia patient</strong>&nbsp;is commonly caused by Salmonella and it most likely affects the&nbsp;<strong>diaphysis</strong>&nbsp;of bones.&nbsp;<strong>Acute chest syndrome </strong>is a&nbsp;vaso-occlusive crisis involving the lungs with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates.&nbsp;<strong>Sequestration crises</strong>&nbsp;is seen in children with intact spleens. Massive entrapment of sickle red cells leads to rapid splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and sometimes shock.&nbsp;<strong>Aplastic crises</strong>&nbsp;occur due to the infection of red cell progenitors by <strong>parvovirus B19, </strong>which causes a transient arrest of erythropoiesis and a sudden worsening of the anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased </strong>susceptibility to infection with<strong> encapsulated organisms</strong> is another risk due to altered splenic function.&nbsp;<strong>Pneumococcus&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> Haemophilus influenzae </strong>septicemia and meningitis are common, particularly in children, but can be <strong>reduced by vaccination </strong>and prophylactic antibiotics.

These cells lack the ability to synthesize proteins that limit the activity of complement. As a result, they are sensitive to lysis by the complement C5b-C9 membrane attack complex</p>\n<p>Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by mutations that most frequently involve ankyrin, band 3, or spectrin (i.e. inherited defects in the membrane skeleton).</p>\n<p><strong>A nonsense mutation</strong>&nbsp;is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon. For example, a point mutation affecting the codon for glutamine (CAG) creates a&nbsp;<strong>stop codon (UAG)</strong>&nbsp;if U is substituted for C. This change leads to premature termination of &beta;-globin gene translation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded.

Now the patient has presented with severe <strong>chest pain</strong> that <strong>began on exertion</strong> (climbing the stairs) and is <strong>not getting relieved even on rest</strong>.

Since&nbsp;the <strong>pelvis</strong> is<strong> favorable</strong>, <strong>face-to-pubis delivery</strong> is possible in this mother.</p>\n<p><strong>Right occipito-posterior position (ROP)</strong> is the most common malposition, which occurs<strong>&nbsp;</strong>when the&nbsp;<strong>occiput</strong>&nbsp;is situated<strong>&nbsp;posteriorly</strong>&nbsp;over the&nbsp;<strong>sacroiliac joint</strong>, or directly over the sacrum. It is associated with the risk of delayed engagement of the head, prolonged labor due to transverse arrest, and the need for cesarean sections.</p>\n<p>Features of the occipito-posterior position include&nbsp;<strong>infra-umbilical flattening</strong>&nbsp;and fetal heart sounds localized to the<strong> flank</strong>. The fetal parts are more prominently felt near the midline. The head engages through the <strong>right oblique diameter</strong> in ROP and the engaging AP diameter is <strong>occipitofrontal</strong> or <strong>suboccipito-frontal</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the majority of cases where the <strong>pelvis is favorable</strong>, uterine <strong>contractions</strong> are <strong>strong</strong>, and no complications arise, it results in <strong>normal vaginal delivery</strong>. With the occiput (back of the baby's head) as the leading part, it rotates approximately <strong>3/8th of a circle towards the front</strong>, positioning itself behind the symphysis pubis. Due to the limitations of the neck's ability to withstand such torsion, the shoulders then rotate about 2/8th of a circle, aligning with the right oblique diameter. Consequently, the remaining progression of labor resembles that of the right occipitoanterior position in ROP.</p>\n<p>When there is <strong>incomplete forward rotation</strong> during labor, the occiput undergoes an <strong>anterior rotation</strong> of approximately 1/8th of a circle, causing the sagittal suture to align with the bi-spinous diameter of the pelvis. Subsequent further anterior rotation is unlikely, and when labor arrest occurs in this position, it is referred to as <strong>deep transverse arrest</strong>.</p>\n<p>In certain instances, the labor process <strong>does not involve rotation</strong> and instead leads to a condition called <strong>oblique posterior arrest</strong>. This occurs when both the sinciput (front part of the baby's head) and the occiput (back part of the head) touch the pelvic floor at the same time. This simultaneous contact is a result of the head being <strong>moderately deflected</strong>, preventing the occiput from rotating. The sagittal suture&nbsp;lies in the oblique diameter.</p>\n<p>When the head is <strong>severely deflected</strong> during labor, it can result in <strong>posterior rotation</strong>, known as the <strong>occipitosacral position</strong>. Under favorable conditions, such as having a baby of average size, strong uterine contractions, and a well-suited pelvis (such as an <strong>anthropoid or spacious gynaecoid pelvis</strong>), spontaneous delivery may occur as <strong>face to pubis</strong>. However, in <strong>unfavorable</strong> situations where labor arrest occurs, it is referred to as <strong>occipitosacral arrest</strong>.</p>\n<p>Indications of <strong>cesarean section</strong> in the occipito-posterior position include the arrest of labor, inadequate uterine contractions, fetal distress, and other obstetrical complications.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 449\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>During the second stage of labor, if the anterior rotation of the occiput is completed, delivery occurs <strong>spontaneously</strong> or may require the application of&nbsp;<strong>ventouse&nbsp;or low forceps</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
