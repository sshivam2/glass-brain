Leprosy can affect peripheral nerves and lead to their associated conditions.</p>\n<p>In <strong>ulnar nerve</strong> palsy, only the <strong>medial two fingers</strong> develop clawing, while in a <strong>combined</strong> <strong>median and ulnar nerve</strong> palsy,\u00a0<strong>all four fingers</strong> develop clawing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <strong>ulnar nerve</strong> supplies the\u00a0<strong>medial two lumbricals</strong> in the hand. The lumbricals have a combined action on metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion and interphalangeal (IP) joint extension (glass holding posture).\u00a0In ulnar nerve injury, since the medial lumbricals are not functional, the forearm muscles are unopposed. Hence, there is hyperextension at\u00a0<strong>MCP</strong> joints\u00a0and flexion at\u00a0<strong>IP</strong> joints<strong>. </strong>This causes claw hand deformity. There is also numbness of the ulnar one and a half fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Elbow fractures or dislocations lead to high lesions of the ulnar nerve. Here, the hand is not markedly deformed because the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus is paralyzed and the fingers, therefore, appear less clawed. This is called the high <strong>ulnar paradox.</strong></p>\n<p>The following tests are done to test the integrity of the ulnar nerve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Egawa's test -\u00a0</strong>In a positive test, due to the\u00a0<strong>weakness of the dorsal interossei</strong>, side-to-side movements of the middle finger is weak.</li>\n<li><strong>Book test or Froment's sign - </strong>The patient is asked to hold a book forcefully while the doctor tries to pull it.<strong>\u00a0</strong>In a positive test, due to\u00a0<strong>weakness of adductor pollicis muscle,</strong>\u00a0adduction of thumb is lost. The patient tries to hold the book by using\u00a0<strong>flexor pollicis longus</strong>\u00a0muscle. This produces flexion at the inter-phalangeal joint while holding the book.</li>\n<li><strong>Card test -\u00a0</strong>In the case of weak palmar interossei, it is easy for the examiner to pull out the card when held between the fingers.<strong>\u00a0</strong>This is due to the loss of adduction by\u00a0<strong>palmar interossei</strong>\u00a0muscles.</li>\n</ul>",
