When there is a rise in blood glucose level, insulin secreted by the pancreatic beta cells binds to its receptors on the plasma membrane of adipocytes. Upon binding of insulin to its receptor, activation of the receptor's tyrosine-kinase domain occurs. This activation starts a protein activation cascade leading to the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane.</p>\n<p>Once translocation occurs and GLUT4 is inserted into the plasma membrane, facilitated diffusion of glucose down its concentration gradient into the cell occurs.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>GLUT-2</strong>\u00a0is found in the <strong>liver, pancreatic \u03b2 cell, small intestine,</strong> and<strong> kidney. </strong>Its function is the rapid uptake or release of glucose.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>GLUT-5\u00a0</strong>is present in the <strong>small intestine</strong> and is involved in the absorption of <strong>fructose</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>SGLT-1\u00a0</strong>is a sodium-dependent unidirectional transporter present in the <strong>small intestine</strong> and <strong>kidney</strong> that is involved in the active uptake of glucose against a concentration gradient.</p>",
