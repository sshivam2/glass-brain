IgE <strong>binds</strong> <strong>to mast cells</strong> and causes sensitivity to environmental antigens. When an antigen comes in contact with the IgE antibody, the antigen-antibody reaction causes <strong>mast cell degranulation</strong>, resulting in <strong>bronchoconstriction</strong> and <strong>edema</strong>. <strong>IL-5</strong> is predominantly involved in <strong>recruitment of eosinophils</strong>.<strong> IL-13</strong> causes <strong>airway hyperresponsiveness</strong> and <strong>mucus hypersecretio</strong>n.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It has now been recognized that <strong>eosinophils</strong> play a <strong>major role</strong> in the pathophysiology of asthma. They induce <strong>airway hyperresponsiveness</strong> by releasing <strong>free radicals</strong> and <strong>major basic protein</strong>, both of which can disrupt the airway epithelium. <strong>Mucus plugs</strong>, which contain significant amounts of <strong>eosinophil aggregates</strong>, accumulate in the airways and also contribute to the severity of asthma.

It estimates the relative utilization of different foods by the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Carbohydrates-&nbsp;</strong>When carbohydrates are metabolized, one molecule of carbon dioxide is released when one molecule of oxygen is utilized. Therefore, the RQ of carbohydrates is <strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>This occurs <strong>immediately after a meal</strong> when the majority of <strong>carbohydrates </strong>are metabolized.</p>\n<p><strong>Fats-&nbsp;</strong>When fats are oxidized, with every 100 molecules of oxygen utilized, an average of 70 carbon dioxide molecules are released. The RQ of fat is therefore<strong> 0.70</strong>. This happens because when oxygen reacts with fats, a large amount of it combines with hydrogen from the fats, forming water instead of carbon dioxide.&nbsp;Around <strong>8-10 hours after</strong> <strong>a meal&nbsp;</strong>the carbohydrate stores are depleted and&nbsp;fats are utilized. The RQ becomes<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>0.70</strong>. In severe<strong> untreated diabetes,</strong> carbohydrates are not utilized as they require insulin. Hence, the RQ remains near that of <strong>fat metabolism</strong>, i.e., <strong>0.70</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Proteins-&nbsp;</strong>When <strong>proteins</strong> are oxidized, with every 100 molecules of oxygen utilized, an average of 80 carbon dioxide molecules are released. Therefore, the RQ of proteins is <strong>0.8.</strong>&nbsp;Protein utilization is better estimated by measuring <strong>nitrogen excretion</strong>. The average protein contains about 16% nitrogen. During the metabolism of the protein, most of the nitrogen is excreted as urea, uric acid, creatinine, and other nitrogen products in the urine and around 10% is excreted in the feces. The utilization of proteins mainly occurs during <strong>starvation,</strong> when the carbohydrate and the fat stores have been depleted.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

It most commonly arises from the <strong>adrenal glands</strong>, followed by sites along the sympathetic chain, such as the paravertebral region of the abdomen and posterior mediastinum.
