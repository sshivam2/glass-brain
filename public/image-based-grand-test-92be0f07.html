LP is considered <strong>contraindicated</strong> if the <strong>platelet count</strong> is <strong>less than 20,000/&mu;L</strong>, and some institutions recommend a platelet count of greater than 40,000/&mu;L before proceeding with the procedure.</p>\n<p><strong>Proper positioning</strong> of the patient is crucial for an LP. The patient should lie on their side away from the examiner, with their knees bent and pulled up toward the abdomen (<strong>lateral decubitus</strong>). The neck should be gently bent forward, and the shoulders and pelvis should be aligned vertically. LP is typically performed at or below the <strong>L3-L4 interspace</strong>, which can be identified by palpating the spinous processes and using a line drawn between the <strong>posterior superior iliac crests</strong> as a guide.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the LP can be done with the patient seated <strong>upright</strong>, leaning forward to flex the back. This position is suitable for obese patients.</p>\n<p>After <strong>sterile preparation</strong> of the insertion site and the injection of a <strong>local anesthetic,</strong>&nbsp;the LP needle is inserted midline between two spinous processes, with the bevel parallel to the dural fibers <strong>facing upwards</strong>. The needle is advanced until the <strong>subarachnoid space</strong> (SAS) is reached indicated by a <strong>loss of resistance</strong>. Once the SAS is reached, the opening pressure is measured, and CSF is allowed to drip into collection tubes for analysis.</p>\n<p>A <strong>traumatic tap</strong>&nbsp;may cause a bloody tap, which can be differentiated from <strong>subarachnoid hemorrhage</strong> (SAH) by examining the supernatant after centrifugation. Prior to needle removal, the <strong>stylet is reinserted</strong> to prevent nerve entrapment and the development of a dural CSF leak. There is <strong>no need for prolonged recumbency</strong> after the procedure to prevent post-LP headache.</p>\n<p><strong>Neuroimaging</strong> is recommended before performing an LP in patients who have an <strong>altered level of consciousness</strong>, <strong>focal neurological deficits</strong>, new-onset <strong>seizures</strong>, or <strong>papilledema</strong>. This is because these patients are at a higher risk of developing cerebellar or tentorial <strong>herniation</strong>, a rare but potentially fatal complication. Imaging studies should also include the spine in patients with symptoms suggestive of <strong>spinal cord compression</strong>, such as back pain, leg weakness, urinary retention, or incontinence. In cases where <strong>acute meningitis</strong> is suspected and neuroimaging is necessary before the LP, it is recommended to administer <strong>antibiotics,</strong>&nbsp;preferably <strong>after blood culture</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>before</strong> conducting the <strong>imaging</strong> study.</p>\n<p>The image below shows Quincke (dura cutting) and Whitacre (dura splitting) LP needles:</p>",

Because of the relative solute reabsorption, there is <strong>dilution</strong> <strong>of the tubular fluid</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>late distal tubule</strong> and <strong>collecting duct</strong> have <strong>two kinds of cells</strong> as mentioned above. <strong>Principal cells</strong> <strong>reabsorb Na<sup>+</sup> and secrete K<sup>+</sup></strong> into the lumen. The Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption is through <strong>epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels (ENaC)</strong>. The expression of ENaC is mediated by <strong>aldosterone</strong> and thus increases whenever there is activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> is balanced by the secretion of K+ into the lumen.</p>\n<p>The <strong>water permeability</strong> of the principal cells is<strong> controlled by ADH</strong>. When <strong>ADH</strong> levels are <strong>high</strong>, <strong>aquaporin 2</strong> channels are <strong>inserted</strong> in the luminal membrane of the principal cells, leading to <strong>water reabsorption</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Intercalated cells</strong> <strong>reabsorb K<sup>+</sup> and secrete H<sup>+</sup></strong> by an <strong>H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> counter-transporter</strong>. They also have an H<sup>+</sup> pump which is responsible for acid secretion.</p>",
