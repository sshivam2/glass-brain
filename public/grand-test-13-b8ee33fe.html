Hydrogen sulfide <strong>inhibits</strong> <strong>complex IV </strong>of the <strong>electron transport chain\u00a0</strong>(ETC) and arrests the respiratory chain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The electron<strong> </strong>transport<strong> </strong>chain<strong> </strong>(ETC) is a specialized set of electron carriers that can accept electrons resulting from the oxidation of energy-rich molecules like glucose. The intermediate substrates in these reactions can pass on electrons to certain <strong>coenzymes</strong> such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (<strong>NAD<sup>+</sup></strong>) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (<strong>FADH2</strong>).</p>\n<p>The reduced forms can then donate electrons to the ETC by which they lose most of their free energy which is used to move H<sup>+</sup> through the inner mitochondrial membrane. The <strong>H+ gradient</strong> thus produced results in the production of ATP. <strong>ATP synthesis</strong> together with <strong>electron transport</strong> is known as <strong>oxidative phosphorylation</strong>.</p>\n<p>The reactions in oxidative phosphorylation and the arrangement of complexes that form the ETC are shown below.</p>",

Exposure to ionizing radiation and limited soft-tissue contrast is the main disadvantage of<strong> CT</strong> that makes it <strong>less useful</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Osteomyelitis</strong> is an acute or chronic inflammatory process involving the bone and its structures secondary to infection with pyogenic organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. The bone becomes susceptible to disease due to large inoculation of microorganisms, from trauma, ischemia, or the presence of foreign bodies because bone sites to which microorganisms can bind are exposed.</p>\n<p>The bone can get infected by a <strong>hematogenous route</strong> through bacteremia seeding of a bone infection from a distant source of infection,&nbsp;contiguous spread from surrounding tissue and joints, or direct inoculation of bone from trauma or surgery. The <strong>most&nbsp;common</strong> pathogen of acute and chronic hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults and children is <em><strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong>.&nbsp;</em>Other common pathogens are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coagulase-negative <em>staphylococcus</em></li>\n<li>Beta-hemolytic <em>streptococcus </em></li>\n<li><em>Enterococci </em></li>\n<li>Aerobic gram-negative bacilli (including<em> pseudomonas</em> species,&nbsp;<em>Enterobacter</em> species, <em>Escherichia</em> coli)</li>\n<li>Anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (such as <em>peptostreptococcus</em>, <em>Clostridium</em> species, <em>Bacteroides</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Osteomyelitis can be <strong>classified</strong> as <strong>acute or chronic</strong> based on histopathological findings rather than the duration of illness. Infection occurring before the development of sequestra is referred to as acute osteomyelitis. It usually takes place within two weeks of disease onset. The infection is considered chronic following the development of necrotic bone and the formation of sequestra. Acute infections generally present with pain, swelling, and redness of the affected area associated with systemic illness while&nbsp;discharging sinuses may be present&nbsp;in chronic infections.</p>\n<p><strong>Surgical debridement</strong> of all diseased bone is required as antibiotics penetrate poorly into infected fluid collections such as abscesses and injured or necrotic bone. Thus, the removal of necrotic tissue and bone is usually indicated where feasible. The cornerstone of treatment for osteomyelitis is <strong>prolonged antibiotic therapy</strong>.</p>",

This prevents the reabsorption of amino acids like <strong>cystine</strong>, ornithine, lysine, and arginine.

Chelating agents such as <strong>penicillamine</strong> have also been found to be useful. <strong>Tiopronin</strong> is currently the best choice drug for cystine reduction, but side effects like nephrotic syndrome may limit its long-term use. A <strong>diet low in methionine</strong> may theoretically reduce the excretion of cystine in the urine by directly reducing its formation.</p>",

    "solution": "<p>The pain relief experienced after rubbing the affected area is due to the stimulation of\u00a0<strong>A\u03b2 sensory fibers.</strong></p>\n<p>The stimulation of <strong>large-type A\u03b2 sensory fibers</strong> from peripheral tactile receptors <strong>depresses pain signal transmission</strong> from the same body area. This occurs due to <strong>local lateral inhibition</strong> in the spinal cord.</p>\n<p>The activity of these cutaneous mechanosensitive afferents may reduce the responsiveness of dorsal horn neurons to the nociceptive input from afferent terminals.\u00a0It explains why rubbing the skin near painful areas offers pain relief, and also explains why the <strong>local application of liniments</strong> relieves pain.</p>\n<p>This is called the <strong>gate-control mechanism</strong> of pain modulation. It is the principle behind the use of <strong>transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</strong> for pain relief. <strong>TENS</strong> uses electrodes to activate <strong>A\u03b1 and A\u03b2 fibers</strong> near the injury.</p>\n<p>Note:<br /><strong>Pain</strong> stimulus is transmitted by <strong>A\u03b4</strong>\u00a0(fast pain) and<strong> C fibers</strong> (slow pain).</p>",

This helps in the absorption of nicotine. This has to be repeated until it releases no more nicotine.</p>\n<p>Nicotine withdrawal is characterized by mood changes, insomnia, poor concentration, restlessness, bradycardia, and weight gain. Withdrawal usually peaks at 1-3 days and lasts up to 3-4 weeks. This makes it difficult to maintain abstinence from cigarette smoking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Nicotine replacement therapy</strong>&nbsp;strategies have been developed to reduce nicotine withdrawal. Therapies include giving nicotine in the form of <strong>gums or patches</strong> for a <strong>period of 1 month</strong> to manage the withdrawal symptoms. It can then be <strong>gradually tapered.</strong></p>\n<p>Nicotine gum is useful in several ways. Firstly, it provides nicotine in <strong>low doses</strong> to <strong>avoid precipitation of withdrawal,&nbsp;</strong>which is usually the reason why patients use tobacco again. Secondly, it is <strong>free of smoke</strong> and other harmful additives. Thirdly, it provides an indirect measure of craving and how heavy tobacco usage was, in the first place.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Chewing it like regular gum</strong> releases all of the nicotine at once, causing <strong>nausea.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Nicotine gum</strong> acts as a nicotine supplement and <strong>is better than a placebo</strong>. Any de-addiction requires motivation, and nicotine replacement might serve as a useful adjunct in motivated individuals.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Vaping or e-cigarettes have adverse effects</strong> on the cardiopulmonary system despite no smoke like conventional cigarettes. It consists of a battery-powered device, that converts a nicotine-containing liquid into vapor which the user inhales through the mouth, and exhales, just like a cigarette. It uses vapor instead of smoke, which is why it is referred to as vaping.</p>",

This patient's clinical picture of amenorrhea, short stature, webbed neck,&nbsp;low posterior hairline, widely spaced nipples, and lack of secondary sexual characteristics is seen in <strong>Turner's syndrome.</strong> Turner's syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality with partial or complete monosomy of the X chromosome (45+XO).</p>\n<p>In Turner's syndrome, <strong>gonadal dysgenesis</strong> causes primary ovarian failure that is <strong>hypogonadism</strong>.
