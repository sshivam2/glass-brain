There is an <strong>irresistible urge</strong> to<strong> shake</strong> the<strong> legs</strong> associated with a <strong>burning sensation, itching,</strong> and <strong>cramps</strong> of the legs. <strong>Moving</strong> the leg or walking <strong>alleviates</strong> the symptoms. This cycle sometimes continues for hours during the night and can result in profound <strong>insomnia</strong>. Decreased dopamine receptor expression and mild dopaminergic hypofunction are usually noted in these patients.</p>\n<p>In patients with restless legs syndrome,<strong> iron stores</strong> are initially repleted, and the aggravating factors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a <strong>gabapentinoid</strong> (pregabalin, gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) is preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). This is due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-term augmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse control disorders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FDA-approved</strong> drugs for the <strong>treatment</strong> of restless leg syndrome:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gabapentin</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ropinirole</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pramipexole</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rotigotine&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects from gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of moderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a history of substance use disorder.</p>",

It heals rapidly without any scar formation.</p>\n<p>This is followed by a<strong> secondary stage</strong> that occurs about 2-6 weeks after the primary stage and manifests as <strong>painful</strong> <strong>lymphadenopathy</strong> that may be unilateral/bilateral and enlarged, tender, painful glands in the groin called <strong>buboes</strong>. A groove-like depression may be observed above and below the inguinal ligament due to enlargement of femoral or inguinal lymph nodes; this is called the<strong> groove sign</strong>.</p>\n<p>A <strong>tertiary stage</strong>&nbsp;usually follows chronic untreated infection. It is associated with stricture formation and fibrosis and fistulae of the anogenital region. Chronic disfiguring granulomatous fibrosis and scarring of the vulva with <strong>esthiomene</strong> formation are also observed in this stage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Esthiomene or elephantiasis of the genitals refers to the hypertrophic enlargement, chronic ulceration and scarring of external genitalia.
