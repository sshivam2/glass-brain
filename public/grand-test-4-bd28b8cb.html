    "solution": "<p><strong>Poor feeding</strong>, <strong>convulsions</strong>, and characteristic<strong> boxing-bicycling</strong> movements with a <strong>positive dinitrophenylhydrazine test</strong> point to the diagnosis of <strong>Maple syrup urine disease</strong> (<strong>MSUD</strong>). The peculiar <strong>burnt sugar odor</strong> of urine is characteristic of this disease.</p>\n<p>Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are the 3 essential amino acids, which are branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Their decarboxylation is accomplished by <strong>branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase</strong>&nbsp;<strong>complex</strong> (BCKDH) using <strong>thiamine</strong> (vitamin B1) pyrophosphate as a <strong>coenzyme</strong>. MSUD is an&nbsp;<strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder that occurs due to a <strong>deficiency</strong> of <strong>BCKDH</strong>. This impairs the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids&nbsp;<strong>valine</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>leucine</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>isoleucine,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>alloisoleucine</strong>.&nbsp;These amino acids, particularly&nbsp;<strong>leucine</strong> and their corresponding &alpha;-keto acids accumulate in the blood, causing toxic effects on the brain. The patient excretes these ketoacids in the urine which will be positive for the <strong>dinitrophenylhydrazine test</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Leucine</strong> is now metabolized by BCAA aminotransferase to<strong> &alpha;-ketoisocaproic acid</strong>, which leads to the disrupted metabolism of neurotransmitters and amino acids (glutamate, GABA, glutamine, alanine, and aspartate). &alpha;-Ketoisocaproic acid can reversibly inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and result in <strong>cerebral lactic acidosis</strong>. It may clinically manifest as <strong>encephalopathy</strong> and <strong>brain edema</strong> known as<strong> leucinosis</strong>. The disease presents as <strong>poor feeding</strong> and <strong>vomiting</strong> on the first few days of life and may progress to lethargy and coma. Examination reveals periods of <strong>hypertonicity</strong> that <strong>alternate</strong> with bouts of <strong>flaccidity</strong>. This appears as repetitive <strong>boxing</strong> and <strong>bicycling movements</strong> of the extremities. Convulsions occur in most infants.</p>\n<p>Treatment options include <strong>restricting dietary</strong> substances and supplementing with <strong>thiamine</strong> for milder forms. <strong>Hemodialysis</strong> is considered in critically ill cases.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Phenylketonuria</strong> (PKU) results from a deficiency of the enzyme <strong>phenylalanine hydroxylase</strong>. It manifests as a progressive <strong>intellectual disability</strong>.&nbsp;Patients with PKU have a <strong>musty or mousy odor</strong> due to phenylacetic acid accumulation and a <strong>positive dinitrophenylhydrazine test</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Hawkinsinuria&nbsp;</strong>is an&nbsp;<strong>autosomal-dominant</strong> condition due to a deficiency of the enzyme <strong>4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase</strong>&nbsp;which&nbsp;catalyzes the reaction of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisic acid in the tyrosine catabolism pathway. It leads to the accumulation of the metabolite <strong>hawkinsin</strong>. Most of the patients present during the weaning period with features of persistent <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> and <strong>failure to thrive</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>swimming pool odor&nbsp;</strong>of the urine is characteristic of this condition.</p>\n<p>Option D: &nbsp;<strong>Type I tyrosinemia</strong>&nbsp;is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme&nbsp;<strong>fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase</strong>. Children present with&nbsp;mild mental retardation,&nbsp;<strong>liver failure</strong>, and <strong>hypoglycemia</strong>. Urine typically has a&nbsp;<strong>boiled cabbage</strong>&nbsp;odor.</p>",

Once these three goals have been achieved, the definitive surgery is planned.</p>\n<p><strong>Indications for temporary abdominal closure</strong> include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Damage control</strong>: patients with severe hemorrhage, hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis</li>\n<li><strong>Abdominal compartment syndrome</strong></li>\n<li>Planned<strong> re-look laparotomy</strong></li>\n<li>Severe <strong>intra-abdominal sepsis</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A vacuum pack for the abdomen is made by using a sheet of plastic (Opsite or Ioban) over the bowel, an intermediate pack of cotton drapes to allow suction, and another sheet of plastic (Opsite or Ioban) draped to the skin to form a watertight and airtight seal. Other techniques of temporary abdominal closure include<strong> Bogota bag</strong> (shown in the image below) and<strong> towel-clip closure.</strong></p>",

The total solute concentration or&nbsp;<strong>osmolarity remains the same</strong> all along the proximal tubule due to the high permeability to water.</p>\n<p>The <strong>thin descending limb</strong>&nbsp;of the <strong>loop of Henle</strong> is <strong>permeable to water</strong>, <strong>urea</strong>, and sodium. The tubular fluid becomes <strong>hypertonic&nbsp;</strong>in this segment. The <strong>thick ascending limb&nbsp;</strong>reabsorbs Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;by a <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;co-transporter</strong>. <strong>Some of the K<sup>+</sup></strong> that is reabsorbed <strong>leaks back</strong> into the lumen, creating a potential difference with more positivity in the lumen. This <strong>lumen positivity</strong> is responsible for the <strong>absorption of divalent ions like Ca<sup>+2&nbsp;</sup>and Mg<sup>+2</sup></strong>. The thick ascending limb is virtually<strong> impermeable to water.&nbsp;</strong>Since some of the solutes are reabsorbed and water is not reabsorbed, it <strong>dilutes</strong> <strong>the tubular fluid</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Early distal convoluted tubule (DCT)</strong> reabsorbs Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> by the <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter</strong>.

Because of the relative solute reabsorption, there is <strong>dilution</strong> <strong>of the tubular fluid</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>late distal tubule</strong> and <strong>collecting duct</strong> have <strong>two kinds of cells</strong> as mentioned above. <strong>Principal cells</strong> <strong>reabsorb Na<sup>+</sup> and secrete K<sup>+</sup></strong> into the lumen. The Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption is through <strong>epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels (ENaC)</strong>. The expression of ENaC is mediated by <strong>aldosterone</strong> and thus increases whenever there is activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> is balanced by the secretion of K+ into the lumen.</p>\n<p>The <strong>water permeability</strong> of the principal cells is<strong> controlled by ADH</strong>. When <strong>ADH</strong> levels are <strong>high</strong>, <strong>aquaporin 2</strong> channels are <strong>inserted</strong> in the luminal membrane of the principal cells, leading to <strong>water reabsorption</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Intercalated cells</strong> <strong>reabsorb K<sup>+</sup> and secrete H<sup>+</sup></strong> by an <strong>H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> counter-transporter</strong>.

Therefore,<strong> intravenous mannitol</strong> should be started and water restriction should be advised for the patients.</p>\n<p>Specific measures:</p>\n<p><strong>Intravenous thrombolysis&nbsp;</strong>with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA), <strong>alteplase</strong>&nbsp;should be immediately administered to patients with ischemic stroke who arrive in the window period (within 4.5 hours of symptom onset).</p>\n<p><strong>Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy</strong> is done in patients who do not respond to thrombolytic therapy or in whom thrombolysis is contraindicated.</p>\n<p><strong>Oral aspirin</strong> with an <strong>initial dose of 325 mg</strong> should be started within 24-48 hours of acute ischemic stroke. It is also continued as an adjunct therapy after intravenous thrombolysis.</p>\n<p>Routine use of heparin and other oral anticoagulants is not recommended in patients with ischemic stroke because they can <strong>increase</strong> the risk of <strong>brain and systemic hemorrhage.</strong> They can be used if the patient is bedridden, in order to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
