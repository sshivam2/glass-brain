Many viruses such as mumps, influenza, coxsackie, adenoviruses, and echoviruses have been clinically implicated in this condition and this condition occurs due to virus-induced host tissue damage that stimulates a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response to one or more thyroid antigens that damages thyroid follicle cells. Peak incidence is observed at 30-50 years and women are generally affected three times more often than men. Histopathology shows the presence of granulomas in the thyroid gland.</p>\n<p>Clinically, it presents as a painfully enlarged thyroid and is sometimes accompanied by fever and examination reveals a small goiter that is very tender.</p>\n<p>It has three distinct phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thyrotoxic phase</li>\n<li>Hypothyroid phase</li>\n<li>Recovery phase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is treated with large doses of\u00a0<strong>aspirin, NSAIDs, steroids, and/or beta-blockers</strong>\u00a0to relieve the observable clinical symptoms.

It is insoluble in water and is known as <strong>unconjugated</strong> (indirect) bilirubin. It is transported to the liver after binding to <strong>albumin,&nbsp;</strong>where&nbsp;it undergoes conjugation with glucuronic acid. The final product is known as <strong>conjugated bilirubin</strong> (direct bilirubin) which drains into the duodenum. On reaching the colon, the unconjugated form is acted upon by <strong>bacterial beta glucuronidases&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;reduced into colorless<strong> urobilinogen</strong>. Almost 90% is excreted through faeces as&nbsp;<strong>stercobilinogen</strong>, and the remaining will undergo <strong>enterohepatic cycling</strong>. A small fraction of this escapes hepatic uptake and will be excreted in the urine as&nbsp;<strong>urobilinogen.</strong></p>",
