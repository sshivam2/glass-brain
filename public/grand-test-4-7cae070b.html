The correct statements about it are<strong> 1,2,3.</strong></p>\n<p>Aldosterone secretion is <strong>stimulated</strong> by <strong>increased angiotensin II levels</strong> and<strong> increased plasma potassium levels. </strong>It stimulates the<strong> reabsorption of sodium</strong> from the principal cells of the collecting duct by increasing the expression of sodium channels (ENaC) and\u00a0 Na+-K+ ATPase activity. It also increases the expression of Na+/K+/2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb and the Na+/Cl- symporter in the distal convoluted tubule.(Statement 1)</p>\n<p>The reabsorption of sodium generates an electrochemical gradient that facilitates chloride and water reabsorption. Aldosterone also <strong>stimulates potassium secretion </strong>by the late distal tubule and collecting ducts and <strong>secretion of hydrogen ions</strong> by the intercalated cells of the collecting duct. There is a loss of K+ lon with H+ ion in the urine leading to <strong>increased urinary acidity</strong>. (Statement 2)</p>\n<p>Though Na+ is retained initially, the plasma Na+ remains normal or only slightly elevated if at all, because water is retained with the osmotically active sodium ions. Consequently, ECF volume is expanded and the blood pressure rises. But at a certain point in ECF expansion, there is the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) which causes Na+ excretion despite increased secretion of aldosterone. This phenomenon is called the <strong>aldosterone escape phenomenon</strong>. Due to this, mineralocorticoids <strong>do not </strong>produce <strong>edema</strong> in <strong>normal individuals</strong> and patients with <strong>hyperaldosteronism</strong>. (Statement 5)</p>\n<p>However, the escape may not occur in <strong>certain disease states,</strong> and in these situations, continued expansion of ECF volume can lead to edema.</p>\n<p>Aldosterone secretion is <strong>increased </strong>by <strong>high potassium intake</strong>,<strong> low sodium intake</strong>, <strong>constriction of the inferior vena cava in the thorax</strong>, <strong>standing, and secondary hyperaldosteronism (</strong>in some cases of heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrosis). Standing for &gt;120 minutes leads to a fall in renal perfusion --&gt; increased renin secretion --&gt; increased <strong>Aldosterone</strong> secretion (Statement 3)</p>\n<p>Aldosterone <strong>does not </strong>cause hyperglycemia; this is the effect of <strong>cortisol</strong>, which increases blood glucose through gluconeogenesis. (Statement 4)</p>\n<p>The adrenal cortex consists of three zones. The outermost zone, zone 1, is known as the zona glomerulosa which secrete mineralocorticoids like<strong> aldosterone</strong> and <strong>deoxycorticosterone. </strong>Zone 2 is known as zona fasciculata, which secretes glucocorticoids like<strong> cortisol and corticosterone.\u00a0</strong>Zone 3 is the<strong> </strong>zona reticularis, and\u00a0secretes <strong>sex steroids </strong>like <strong>DHEA </strong>and<strong> androstenedione.\u00a0</strong>The adrenal medulla, represented by zone 4 secretes the <strong>catecholamines epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.\u00a0</strong>Image showing the histological section of the adrenal gland -</p>",

However, for an acute episode with\u00a0severe symptoms, benzodiazepines like <strong>alprazolam</strong> should be started <strong>concurrently</strong> <strong>with SSRIs</strong> and slowly tapered off.

These work especially well when used in combination with pharmacotherapy. These help in producing <strong>long-lasting remissions</strong> of symptoms.</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Alprazolam</strong> is a benzodiazepine with a <strong>high risk of psychological</strong> and <strong>physical</strong> <strong>dependence</strong> if used in the long term. Therefore it is used as an adjunct to SSRIs or psychotherapy and not used as a primary treatment.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Phenelzine</strong> is a <strong>monoamine oxidase</strong> inhibitor. MAOIs may require certain dietary restrictions and hence are used less often.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Imipramine</strong> is a tricyclic anti-depressant that can be used for panic disorder as a second-line drug.\u00a0TCAs are used less often than SSRIs because they are associated with <strong>more adverse effects</strong> at the dosages\u00a0required for the treatment of panic disorder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

If this urea is reabsorbed via the descending limb of the loop of Henle without any control, it will result in life-threatening dehydration due to loss of osmolality in the renal medullary interstitium. Therefore, <strong>higher concentration</strong>s of urea in the renal medullary interstitium are maintained by the <strong>Vasa recta</strong>.</p>\n<p>Urea from the interstitium is taken up by the descending limb of the vasa recta, and the urea is given out by the ascending limb of the vasa recta. This ensures that <strong>high concentrations</strong> of urea <strong>remain</strong> in the <strong>medullary interstitium</strong>. This is called the <strong>counter-current</strong> <strong>exchange mechanism</strong>.

The characteristic signs of cardiac tamponade include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulsus paradoxus - </strong>This is a paradoxical reduction in the systemic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) on inspiration. In tamponade, the increase in venous return to the right side (during inspiration) of the heart causes the interventricular septum to bow towards the left ventricle (fixed total heart volume), thereby reducing the left heart volume. This leads to a reduction in stroke volume and systemic blood pressure.\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Beck's triad - </strong>This is a triad of findings in tamponade that consists of <strong>hypotension </strong>(90/56 mmHg),\u00a0<strong>muffled heart sounds,\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>elevated jugular venous pressure.\u00a0</strong>Features of JVP in tamponade include\u00a0prominent x descent and absent y descent.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n<li><strong>ECG - </strong>ECG shows<strong>\u00a0</strong>reduced voltage and electrical alternans.
