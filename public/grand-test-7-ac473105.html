The correct</strong>&nbsp;answer is <strong>1, 2, 3, 4.</strong></p>\n<p>Rh alloimmunization occurs when an <strong>Rh-negative mother</strong> produces <strong>antibodies</strong> to Rh antigens due to an <strong>Rh-positive fetus</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alloimmunization occurs in two stages. First, <strong>sensitization</strong> occurs during the first pregnancy, then the <strong>immunization</strong> occurs. Sensitization occurs during situations of<strong> fetomaternal bleeds.</strong> Examples of these situations include miscarriage, <strong>amniocentesis</strong>, embryoreduction, ectopic pregnancy, hydatidiform mole, cordocentesis, placenta previa with bleeding, <strong>abruption of placenta</strong>, intrauterine fetal demise, external cephalic version, <strong>abdominal trauma</strong>, and <strong>delivery of an Rh-positive infant to an Rh-negative mother</strong>. It can also occur during the third stage of labor, manual removal of placenta, and after a cesarean section.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rh immunization can be prevented if the mother is unimmunized. Here, she is given <strong>Rh anti-D immunoglobulin</strong> (IgG) intramuscularly after childbirth. This blocks the Rh-antigen of the fetal cells, removal of the intact, antibody-coated fetal red cells from circulation by the spleen or lymph nodes, and inhibits the production of IgG from the B cells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should ideally be administered within 72 hours or preferably earlier after delivery or abortion. The dose can be calculated using the <strong>Kleihauer-Betke</strong> test.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The antibodies formed as a result of immunization are <strong>IgM</strong> and <strong>IgG</strong>. However, only<strong> IgG antibodies</strong> are small enough to <strong>cross the placenta</strong> and cause hemolytic disease in the fetus. The three manifestations of the hemolytic disease include hydrops fetalis, icterus gravis neonatorum, and congenital anemia of the newborn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hydrops fetalis</strong>&nbsp;(Option B) is the most severe form of Rh hemolytic disease in the fetus. There is widespread erythrocyte destruction leading to anemia, anoxemia, and metabolic acidosis. This leads to hepatic injury, causing hypoproteinemia and subsequently generalized edema, ascites, and hydrothorax.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following image shows a stillborn baby with hydrops fetalis.&nbsp;</p>",

This is referred to as <strong>gene silencing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RNA interference (RNAi)</strong> is a biological process in which miRNA/siRNA molecules inhibit gene expression by neutralizing targeted mRNAs. The miRNA belongs to a group of&nbsp;non-coding genes.&nbsp;The miRNA genes are transcribed but not translated into proteins.&nbsp;<strong>siRNA is similar in function to miRNA and is used in RNA interference.</strong></p>\n<p>Mechanism of biosynthesis of miRNA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>&nbsp;<strong>gene</strong>&nbsp;present in the nucleus is transcribed to&nbsp;<strong>primary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>, which is further converted to&nbsp;<strong>pre-miRNA</strong>&nbsp;by an enzyme<strong>&nbsp;drosha&nbsp;</strong>intranuclearly and exported to the cytoplasm by an <strong>exportin 5</strong> protein.</li>\n<li>The pre-miRNA undergoes trimming, by an enzyme called&nbsp;<strong>dicer</strong>, into&nbsp;<strong>mature</strong>&nbsp;<strong>single-stranded</strong>&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>.</li>\n<li>The mature miRNA is associated with a multiprotein aggregate called&nbsp;<strong>RISC</strong>.</li>\n<li>The target mRNAs contain seed sequences in their&nbsp;<strong>3&prime; untranslated region (UTR)&nbsp;</strong>that determines the specificity of miRNA binding and gene silencing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>miRNA expression has been found to be <strong>dysregulated</strong> in many <strong>cancers</strong>. Some types of miRNAs are <strong>oncogenic</strong> referred to as<strong> oncomiRs</strong> and are overexpressed in cancerous tissue. On the other hand,<strong> tumor-suppressive miRNAs</strong> that counteract oncogenic characteristics are found to be <strong>underexpressed</strong> in cancers.&nbsp;</p>",

The &beta;-lactam antibiotics inhibit this last step in peptidoglycan synthesis. They inhibit the enzyme&nbsp;<strong>transpeptidase</strong>&nbsp;which is required for cross-linking of the peptidoglycan chain. Transpeptidases cleave the terminal <strong>D-alanine</strong> of the peptide chains and form cross-linkages between them. This cross-linking provides <strong>rigidity</strong> and stability to the cell wall.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Transpeptidases and other related proteins constitute <strong>penicillin-binding proteins(PBP)</strong> and, are located in the bacterial cell membrane. &beta;-lactam antibiotics are <strong>bactericidal</strong>. This is because bacterias swell and burst due to deficient cell walls when they divide in the presence of &beta;-lactam antibiotics. <strong>Penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams</strong>, and <strong>carbapenems</strong> are examples of &beta;-lactam antibiotics.</p>\n<p><strong>Gram-positive bacteria</strong> are more susceptible to &beta;-lactam antibiotics than gram-negative because their cell wall is almost entirely made of peptidoglycan.</p>\n<p>Resistance to&nbsp;&beta;-lactam antibiotics develops due to the production of the<strong> beta-lactamase</strong> enzyme and the development of altered penicillin-binding proteins like in methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (<strong>MRSA</strong>). &beta;-lactamases&nbsp;inactivate &beta;-lactam antibiotics by opening the &beta;-lactam ring. This could be overcome by using drugs that&nbsp;inhibit this enzyme. Examples of <strong>&beta;-lactamase inhibitors</strong> are <strong>clavulanic acid</strong>, <strong>sulbactam</strong>, and <strong>tazobactam.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Fosfomycin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 1</strong> in the image. It inhibits the cytoplasmic enzyme<strong>&nbsp;enol pyruvate transferase </strong>that catalyses the initial step in the bacterial cell wall and hence cell wall synthesis. It is used for the treatment of urinary tract infections.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Bacitracin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 2</strong> in the image. It is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor that interferes with&nbsp;<strong>dephosphorylation</strong> in the cycling of the <strong>lipid carrier</strong> which transfers&nbsp;peptidoglycan subunits to the growing cell wall. It is only given for topical application because of its severe nephrotoxicity when given systemically.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Vancomycin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 3</strong> in the image. It binds to the <strong>D-Ala-D-Ala terminus</strong> of the newly formed peptidoglycan pentapeptide. This <strong>prevents further elongation</strong> of <strong>the peptidoglycan</strong> and its cross-linking. It is used against MRSA and <em><strong>Clostridium difficile </strong></em>infection. <strong>Redman syndrome</strong> due to histamine release following infusion is an important side effect.</p>",

This leads to the formation of<strong> urine </strong>with<strong> pH &gt; 5.5.</strong>\u00a0The decreased H<sup>+</sup> secretion also leads to <strong>inadequate HCO<sup>3-</sup> regeneration</strong> in the\u00a0alpha-intercalated cells thus leading to <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>. As <strong>H<sup>+</sup> </strong>is<strong> usually exchanged </strong>with<strong> K<sup>+</sup></strong> from the lumen in the DCT, <strong>decreased H<sup>+</sup> secretion</strong> is also associated with <strong>decreased K<sup>+</sup> absorption</strong>, resulting in <strong>hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Acidosis</strong> reduces net <strong>proximal fluid reabsorption</strong>, which leads to <strong>volume contraction</strong> and <strong>activation </strong>of the<strong> renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system</strong> (RAAS). This results in <strong>decreased proximal tubular Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption</strong> and increased distal delivery of Na<sup>+</sup> to the cortical collecting duct. These processes, along with increased aldosterone secretion, leading to increased K<sup>+</sup> secretion by activation of ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) channels in the collecting duct thus causing <strong>hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ammonium</strong> produced as a result of glutamine metabolism is <strong>secreted in the proximal tubule</strong>, which <strong>normally combines with H<sup>+</sup> ions</strong> secreted in the alpha-intercalated cells of the distal tubule to form NH4<sup>+</sup> ions. Since this process is impaired in RTA-1, the <strong>urine anion gap (UAG) is positive</strong> due to <strong>low urine NH4<sup>+\u00a0</sup>concentration</strong>.

There is no defect in the urine concentrating mechanism at the\u00a0cortical collecting tubule, thus\u00a0urine NH4<sup>+\u00a0</sup>concentration is normal and <strong>UAG </strong>is<strong> negative</strong>.
