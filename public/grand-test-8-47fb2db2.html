In <strong>trigeminal neuralgia</strong>, <strong>compression</strong> <strong>of the large fibers</strong> leads to their <strong>demyelination</strong>. These demyelinated large fibers become <strong>hyperexcitable</strong> and\u00a0<strong>electrically coupled</strong> with<strong> </strong>the surrounding <strong>smaller unmyelinated pain fibers</strong>\u00a0of the trigeminal nerve. This explains why <strong>tactile stimulation of trigger zones</strong>\u00a0<strong>leads to pain</strong> paroxysms.</p>\n<p><strong>Carbamazepine</strong>\u00a0is the<strong>\u00a0</strong>first-line drug in the management of patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Lamotrigine, phenytoin, topiramate, or gabapentin are other options that may be tried if carbamazepine is ineffective. <strong>Microvascular decompression</strong> of the trigeminal nerve can be done if medical therapies fail.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Options A, B: Cluster headache</strong> and <strong>SUNCT</strong> are examples of <strong>trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias</strong>. Both of them are characterized by a <strong>stabbing</strong> type of <strong>pain</strong> in the <strong>periorbital region</strong>, along with <strong>autonomic features</strong> such as <strong>lacrimation</strong> and <strong>conjunctival tearing</strong> on the ipsilateral side and <strong>nasal stuffiness</strong>. Since this patient has no autonomic features, both of these options can be ruled out.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: Temporal arteritis</strong>\u00a0is usually accompanied by manifestations in other systems (such as <strong>myalgias</strong>) and <strong>signs of inflammation</strong> (such as <strong>raised ESR</strong> and <strong>CRP</strong>). The patient might also have <strong>visual disturbances</strong> which can lead to <strong>permanent blindness</strong>. Furthermore, the <strong>pain is</strong> usually <strong>constant</strong> and does not have triggers as in the case of trigeminal neuralgia.\u00a0</p>",

All neuromuscular blocking agents are quaternary ammonium compounds with an affinity for <strong>nicotinic ACh receptors</strong> due to the positively charged nitrogen present in them.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Depolarising muscle relaxants </strong>(DMRs), such as <strong>succinylcholine\u00a0</strong>(SCh) closely resemble the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). When administered, they rapidly bind to the ACh receptors on the muscle end-plate and cause depolarization. Unlike ACh, DMRs are not metabolized by the acetylcholinesterase\u00a0enzyme. This results in their prolonged presence in the synaptic cleft. As a result, there is <strong>continuous endplate depolarization.</strong></p>\n<p>This continuous endplate depolarization does not allow the endplate to repolarize. Hence, the time-limited perijunctional sodium channels that were inactivated during depolarization fail to re-open. This leads to muscle relaxation.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-Depolarising muscle relaxants\u00a0</strong>(NDMRs)\u00a0such as <strong>atracurium, pancuronium,</strong> etc compete with ACh and bind to its receptors, preventing the action of ACh on its receptors. However, the NDMRs are incapable of inducing the conformational change necessary for ion channel opening. Hence, their binding does not lead to the development of end-plate potential.</p>\n<p>Thus, <strong>DMRs </strong>behave as <strong>ACh receptor agonists </strong>while<strong> NDMRs </strong>behave as <strong>competitive antagonists.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>In the given clinical scenario, where there is a history of a <strong>chronic denervation injury</strong>, the physiological response is that of <strong>overexpression</strong> of <strong>ACh</strong> <strong>receptors</strong> on the muscle membranes. These overexpressed receptors are low conductance receptors with a prolonged opening time, similar to fetal nicotinic ACh receptors.</p>\n<p>The prolonged opening time of these receptors leads to an exaggerated response to DMRs. Whereas, the increased number of receptors leads to resistance to the action of NDMRs, as the NDMRs now cannot block all these receptors. The net effect is an <strong>exaggerated response to DMR </strong>and<strong> resistance to NDMR.</strong></p>\n<p>The opposite happens in conditions like <strong>myasthenia gravis</strong>, where the number of ACh receptors is greatly reduced. This leads to an <strong>exaggerated response to NDMRs</strong> due to complete antagonism of all receptors and <strong>resistance to DMRs</strong> due to an inadequate number of receptors being depolarized. (Option C)</p>\n<p>Options A and B are not possible in this scenario.</p>",

Mutations occur in the V<sub>2</sub> receptor or the aquaporin channels and ADH cannot act on them. Therefore, in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, even if the ADH levels are normal, it cannot act on the receptors, and the <strong>urine osmolality </strong>does<strong> not increase</strong> after fluid restriction. A simpler way to differentiate between central DI and nephrogenic DI is to measure <strong>basal ADH levels</strong> and <strong>urine osmolality</strong> under unrestricted fluid intake conditions.

A low ADH level is suggestive of central DI or primary polydipsia, which can be differentiated on MRI brain.</p>\n<p>Option C:\u00a0<strong>Syndrome </strong>of<strong> inappropriate ADH secretion</strong> results in increased secretions of ADH.
