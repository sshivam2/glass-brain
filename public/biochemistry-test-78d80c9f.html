The most likely pathway responsible for his condition is the <strong>polyol pathway</strong>.</p>\n<p>The polyol pathway involves the conversion of <strong>glucose to sorbitol</strong> by the enzyme <strong>aldose reductase</strong>. Under normal conditions, only a small amount of glucose is processed through this pathway. However, in <strong>chronic hyperglycemia</strong>, as seen in poorly controlled diabetes, the activity of aldose reductase is significantly increased. This leads to an excessive accumulation of sorbitol, especially in tissues that have low sorbitol dehydrogenase activity, such as the <strong>lens</strong> of the eye, <strong>retina, kidney, </strong>and<strong> peripheral nerves</strong>.</p>\n<p>Sorbitol, being an osmotically active substance, cannot easily diffuse across cell membranes and tends to accumulate within the cells. This accumulation causes <strong>osmotic stress</strong>, drawing water into the cells, leading to cellular swelling and damage. In the lens of the eye, this osmotic damage disrupts the normal structure and function of lens proteins, leading to the formation of cataracts. This is why diabetic patients with poorly controlled blood sugar levels are at a higher risk of developing cataracts, as well as other complications such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Galactokinase</strong> catalyzes the conversion of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to mild galactosemia, resulting in cataract formation due to the accumulation of galactitol in the lens of the eye. This condition is unrelated to diabetes mellitus and instead is seen in disorders of galactose metabolism such as galactokinase deficiency.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Aldolase B </strong>converts fructose-1-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde. Overactivity of this enzyme has not been linked to any specific pathological condition. Deficiency of aldolase B results in hereditary fructose intolerance, which is characterized by hypoglycemia and vomiting following the ingestion of fructose-containing foods. This condition does not lead to cataract formation and is unrelated to the metabolic pathways affected in diabetes.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Gluconeogenesis</strong> is the metabolic process by which glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources, such as lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids. While this process is crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting states, it is not directly involved in the formation of cataracts. Cataracts in diabetic patients are primarily due to the osmotic damage caused by the accumulation of sorbitol through the polyol pathway, not gluconeogenesis.</p>",
