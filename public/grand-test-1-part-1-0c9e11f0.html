Humans are the<strong> definitive host.</strong> It has<strong> no intermediate host</strong>. It occurs more commonly in children and the patient acquires this infection by ingesting food or water contaminated with its eggs. The egg attaches to the intestine and develops into the larva and adult worm. The adult worm resides in the small intestine. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Patients are usually<strong> asymptomatic</strong>. However, in heavy infections, they present with nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain,<strong> diarrhoea</strong>, and irritability. <strong>Pruritus</strong> may also be present due to an allergic response. It can also cause<strong> autoinfection</strong>. Internal autoinfection occurs when the eggs are released in the intestine and hatch there. External autoinfection occurs through the ingestion of the eggs by the fecal-oral route. They hatch in the small intestine to release the hexacanth embryo, which penetrates the intestinal villus, resulting in autoinfection.</p>\n<p>The image given below shows the egg of Hymenolepis nana.</p>",

In its fulminant form, meningococcemia presents with high fever and a <strong>hemorrhagic rash</strong> and can lead to severe complications like <strong>disseminated intravascular coagulation</strong>, circulatory collapse, and<strong> Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome,</strong> characterized by<strong> bilateral adrenal gland necrosis</strong> and subsequent adrenal failure.</p>\n<p>Meningitis can rapidly progress to<strong> fulminant meningococcemia</strong>, evolving from acute illness to severe disease in hours.
