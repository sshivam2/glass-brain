It prevents ovum passage and fertilization. Procedures done at the time of delivery are termed puerperal sterilization.\u00a0For puerperal sterilization, <strong>suture ligation with tubal segment removal</strong> is more frequently employed. A tubal sterilization procedure done at a time unrelated to recent pregnancy is called non-puerperal tubal sterilization or interval sterilization. Currently, non-puerperal tubal sterilization is mainly accomplished via <strong>laparoscopy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Endocercival polyps</strong>\u00a0are mucinous columnar epithelium-covered benign endocervical stroma overgrowths. They often present as a single, elongated mass that is red, smooth, and projecting from the endocervical canal.<strong>\u00a0Ring forceps</strong> are used to grab endocervical polyps for excision if the stalk is thin. The stalk base of the polyp is repeatedly twisted. Surgical ligation and excision of a thick pedicle may be necessary if further severe bleeding is expected.\u00a0Although hysteroscopy can help visualize and assess these polyps, their removal is typically performed using forceps, either during a pelvic examination or during a colposcopy. Hysteroscopy is not the primary method for managing endocervical polyps.</p>\n<p>Option D -<strong> Subserosal fibroids</strong> carry higher risks for incomplete resection, difficult visualization, or uterine perforation with hysteroscopic myomectomy. Hence, a\u00a0number of parameters are taken into consideration while choosing a surgical strategy for subserosa or intramural myomas. Successful results and low recurrence rates are seen after<strong> laparoscopic leiomyoma excision.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

The prognosis for stage IIB cervical cancer depends on various factors, such as the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and the patient's overall health.

    "solution": "<p>The most likely diagnosis in this patient with a history of alcohol dependence, sudden unintentional weight loss, and <strong>raised AFP</strong> is <strong>hepatocellular carcinoma</strong> (HCC).</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 624\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>HCC</strong> is the <strong>most common cause of primary liver cancer</strong>. It is more commonly seen in males, and the peak age group is between 65-70 years. The <strong>main risk factor</strong> for HCC is <strong>cirrhosis</strong> and associated chronic liver damage due to chronic infection by hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV), <strong>alcohol abuse</strong>, metabolic syndrome, or hemochromatosis. The<strong> incidence </strong>of<strong> HCC</strong> is <strong>increasing</strong> worldwide. This is contributed by the increase in HCV and HBV infections, along with lifestyle disorders like obesity.&nbsp;Obesity is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This progresses on to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) causing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus,&nbsp;NASH and NAFLD are risk factors for HCC.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regular surveillance, including liver imaging and monitoring of alpha-fetoprotein levels, is recommended for high-risk populations, such as those with liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B or C infection, or significant alcohol consumption. Early detection of HCC can improve treatment outcomes and overall prognosis.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Very early HCC is treated by ablation. Early HCC with a single nodule is resected, but when there are multiple nodules over 3 cm, ablation or transplantation are considered.&nbsp;Intermediate-stage HCC is treated by chemoembolization.&nbsp;Transarterial chemoembolization (<strong>TACE</strong>) is used for multinodular lesions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Hepatic adenomas</strong> are <strong>benign liver tumors</strong> that are often <strong>associated with oral contraceptive use</strong> and <strong>anabolic steroid use</strong>.&nbsp;The patient's history of alcohol dependence and high alpha-fetoprotein levels are not consistent with hepatic adenoma. Additionally, hepatic adenomas are usually <strong>asymptomatic</strong> and do not present with sudden unintentional weight loss.</p>\n<p>Option B: Cholangiocarcinoma&nbsp;is a cancer that arises from the bile ducts within the liver. While patients with alcohol dependence may have an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma, the <strong>elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels are not typical</strong> for this type of cancer. Cholangiocarcinomas usually <strong>present with jaundice, pruritus, and abdominal pain</strong>, but sudden weight loss is less characteristic.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Alcoholic hepatitis</strong> is an inflammation of the liver caused by excessive alcohol consumption. It usually presents with jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. While the patient's history of alcohol dependence might suggest alcoholic hepatitis, elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels and unintentional weight loss are not typical for this condition. Moreover, the AST/ALT ratio is usually greater than 2 in alcoholic hepatitis, but it is 0.5 in this case.</p>",

    "solution": "<p>In this case of <strong>chronic pancreatitis with recurrent attacks</strong>, 10 mm <strong>dilatation</strong> of the pancreatic <strong>duct</strong>, and <strong>intraductal calculi</strong>, <strong>longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy</strong> (also known as Puestow procedure or lateral pancreaticojejunostomy) is the <strong>surgery of choice</strong>. This procedure involves opening the pancreatic duct along its length and connecting it to a loop of the jejunum, which helps to drain the obstructed pancreatic duct and alleviate pain.</p>\n<p>Patients with chronic pancreatitis mainly experience pain due to ductal hypertension or parenchymal inflammation. Acute exacerbations in duct pressure lead to recurrent acute attacks.&nbsp;The pancreatic duct dilation observed on pancreatography for chronic pancreatitis is classically described as a <strong>chain of lakes</strong>, which reflects the presence of <strong>multiple dilations and stenoses</strong>. Response to treatment has been found to be dependent upon the degree of preoperative pancreatic fibrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy</strong>, also known as the <strong>Puestow procedure or lateral pancreaticojejunostomy</strong>, is a surgical treatment primarily used for chronic pancreatitis with a dilated main pancreatic duct and intraductal calculi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy, a <strong>longitudinal incision</strong> is made along the length of the main pancreatic duct, typically from the tail to the head of the pancreas. The dilated pancreatic duct is then opened, and any <strong>intraductal calculi or obstructions are removed</strong>. The opened duct is then <strong>connected to a loop of the jejunum</strong>&nbsp;to create a <strong>side-to-side anastomosis</strong>. This allows for the drainage of pancreatic secretions directly into the jejunum, bypassing any narrowed or obstructed areas of the duct.</p>\n<p>This procedure can effectively relieve pain and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic pancreatitis. However, it is important to note that it may not reverse the underlying pathology of chronic pancreatitis or prevent the progression of the disease. It is also not suitable for all patients with chronic pancreatitis, particularly those with a non-dilated pancreatic duct or isolated head involvement.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p><strong>Pancreaticoduodenectomy</strong>:&nbsp;This procedure, also known as Whipple procedure, involves removing the head of the pancreas, duodenum, gallbladder, and part of the bile duct. It is typically performed for pancreatic cancer or tumors in the head of the pancreas, not for chronic pancreatitis with ductal obstruction and intraductal calculi.</p>\n<p><strong>ERCP and sphincterotomy</strong>: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy is a procedure that involves opening the sphincter of Oddi to facilitate the drainage of bile and pancreatic secretions. Although it may provide temporary relief, it is not a definitive treatment for chronic pancreatitis with large ductal dilatation and intraductal calculi. ERCP with sphincterotomy may be useful in some cases of chronic pancreatitis for the removal of small pancreatic duct stones, but for large ductal dilatation and intraductal calculi, longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy is more appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>Coring of pancreas head</strong>: Coring of the pancreas head, also known as pancreatic head resection or Beger procedure, is a surgical technique used to treat chronic pancreatitis, particularly when the inflammation and fibrosis predominantly affect the head of the pancreas. The procedure involves removing the inflamed and fibrotic tissue from the head of the pancreas while preserving the duodenum, bile duct, and the main pancreatic duct. Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy is a more targeted and effective treatment for this patient's condition.</p>",

In Durkan's test, <strong>direct compression</strong> of the <strong>median nerve</strong> is done for about 30 seconds, which elicits <strong>paresthesias </strong>and <strong>pain</strong> in cases of carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>C</strong><strong>arpal tunnel syndrome</strong>\u00a0is the most common entrapment mononeuropathy caused by compression of the\u00a0<strong>median nerve</strong> as it passes through the fibro-osseous carpal tunnel beneath the flexor retinaculum. Patients present with <strong>pain</strong> and <strong>paresthesia</strong> over the <strong>radial 3 and a half digits</strong>. There may be a weakness of thumb opposition. In chronic cases, the thenar eminence is wasted. Carpal tunnel syndrome can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, and gout. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds but <strong>nerve conduction studies</strong> can confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Other tests for CTS -</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Phalen's test</strong>\u00a0- Elicited by holding the wrist flexed fully.

Due to\u00a0<strong>weakness of the adductor pollicis muscle,</strong>\u00a0adduction of the thumb is lost. When asked to hold a book, the patient tries to hold the book by using the flexor pollicis longus muscle instead of the adductor, this produces flexion at the interphalangeal joint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The picture below shows Froment's test</p>",

Spontaneous SAH usually results from the rupture of an aneurysm or an arterio-venous malformation (AVM).&nbsp;Patients present with a<strong>&nbsp;sudden</strong> and <strong>severe headache</strong> which is different from any headache they have experienced before. This is described as a&nbsp;<strong>thunderclap headache. </strong>Other symptoms include meningitic features like neck rigidity and photophobia, impaired consciousness, intraocular hemorrhages, with or without focal neurological deficits. Compression from a posterior communicating artery aneurysm would result in third nerve palsy.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-contrast CT</strong> head is the first imaging to be done in a suspected case, which would confirm bleeding in more than 98% of cases.&nbsp;In patients with high suspicion and a <strong>negative CT</strong>, <strong>lumbar puncture</strong> is done to detect hemoglobin breakdown products like oxyhemoglobin and bilirubin. <strong>After confirming the diagnosis</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>CT or MR angiography</strong> is done to locate the aneurysms or AVM. <strong>Digital subtraction angiography</strong>&nbsp;remains the&nbsp;<strong>gold standard</strong>&nbsp;investigation.</p>\n<p>The definitive management of&nbsp;<strong>subarachnoid hemorrhage (</strong><strong>SAH)</strong>&nbsp;is done surgically by craniotomy and <strong>clipping</strong> or by <strong>endovascular embolization</strong> known as <strong>coiling. </strong>This prevents<strong> rebleeding</strong> of the aneurysm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are at risk of developing complications such as rebleeding, cerebral vasospasm, hydrocephalus, seizures, and hyponatremia. Early recognition and management of these complications are essential to improve outcomes. In addition to surgery and nimodipine, other management strategies for SAH include strict blood pressure control, analgesia for headache, antiemetics, and anticonvulsants if seizures occur. Maintaining a close monitoring of the patient's neurological status, intracranial pressure, and electrolytes is also crucial.</p>\n<p>Other Options</p>\n<p><strong>Nimodipine</strong>: Although it is used to prevent cerebral vasospasm and delayed ischemic neurological deficits, it is not the immediate next step in the management of SAH. Angiography is needed first to locate the aneurysms or AVM. It is administered after the procedure.<br /><strong>Surgery</strong>: Although surgery is an important management option for SAH, it is not the immediate next step. Angiography must be done first to identify the site of the bleed and plan for the appropriate surgical or endovascular intervention.<br /><strong>Fibrinolytic therapy</strong>: This option is not appropriate for the management of SAH as it may exacerbate the bleeding. Fibrinolytic therapy is used in the treatment of ischemic stroke, not hemorrhagic stroke.</p>",

Syncope, tachycardia, and hypotension are produced as a result. The patient is rapidly turned to a <strong>lateral posture</strong> to return the blood pressure to normal.

The presence of 2 or more qSOFA points is a simple prompt to identify infected patients outside the ICU who are likely to develop sepsis. This is a simplified derivative of SOFA score. The primary method to evaluate the risk of organ dysfunction (sepsis) in patients with suspected infection is by determining the&nbsp;<strong>Sequential</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score,</strong>&nbsp;which includes assessment of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Circulation - Systolic BP and need for vasopressors; platelet count</li>\n<li>Respiration - PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and need for mechanical ventilation</li>\n<li>Mentation - Glasgow Coma Scale score&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Hepatic function - Bilirubin level</li>\n<li>Renal function - Creatinine level</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Organ dysfunction</strong>&nbsp;is defined by a&nbsp;<strong>SOFA score of&nbsp;&ge;2</strong>.</p>\n<p>The SOFA score is limited by its requirement of multiple laboratory tests which makes it complex and time-consuming.
