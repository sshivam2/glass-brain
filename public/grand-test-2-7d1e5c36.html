When there is a <strong>mutation</strong> in tyrosine kinase receptor RET, it results in <strong>premature arrest</strong> of this regular <strong>migration</strong> from the cecum to the rectum. This results in the lack of Auerbach and Meissner submucosal plexus in the distal intestinal segment (<strong>aganglionosis</strong>) causing<strong>&nbsp;hypertonicity </strong>of the<strong> bowel wall</strong>. Thus, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>functional&nbsp;obstruction</strong> in the<strong> distal segment</strong>&nbsp;that also results in massive&nbsp;<strong>dilatation </strong>of the<strong> proximal segment </strong>(<strong>megacolon</strong>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Based on the segments affected, they are classified into -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short-segment Hirschsprung disease -&nbsp;Disease limited to the rectosigmoid segment</li>\n<li>Long-segment Hirschsprung disease -&nbsp;Disease having proximal extension beyond the rectosigmoid segment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The onset of <strong>constipation</strong> can be seen <strong>at birth</strong>. Patients present with intermittent attacks of fever and <strong>pain</strong> due to intestinal obstruction from the retained feces. Complications include&nbsp;<strong>enterocolitis</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>bowel perforation</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Rectal suction biopsy</strong> is the<strong> gold standard</strong> for diagnosis and shows increased <strong>acetylcholinesterase staining</strong> and <strong>aganglionosis</strong>. Other investigations include <strong>anorectal manometry</strong> and <strong>barium contrast enema</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Surgical intervention is the only definitive treatment available.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis</strong> generally presents as new-onset <strong>regurgitation</strong> and <strong>projectile non-bilious vomiting</strong> after feeding. A firm <strong>abdominal mass</strong> and <strong>abnormal left-to-right hyperperistalsis</strong> can be seen. Diagnosis is made by ultrasonography.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Wilkie syndrome</strong>, otherwise known as <strong>superior mesenteric artery syndrome</strong>, occurs due to the <strong>compression </strong>of the<strong> third duodenal segment</strong> against the aorta by this artery. Diagnosis is by radiological demonstration of duodenal cutoff along with proximal duodenal dilatation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Functional constipation</strong>, otherwise known as fecal withholding, is the <strong>intentional</strong> or subconscious <strong>withholding of stool</strong>. It usually starts <strong>after </strong>the<strong> neonatal period</strong>. Here <strong>daytime encopresis</strong> (passage of stools at inappropriate places after 4 years of age) is common.</p>",

In this test, the inactivated serum of a patient is mixed with 1% suspension of <strong>sheep erythrocytes </strong>in serial dilutions.
