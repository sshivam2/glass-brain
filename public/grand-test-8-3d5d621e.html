The case described here is that of <strong>lathyrism.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Lathyrism is a paralyzing disease of humans and animals.&nbsp;It is due to the consumption of&nbsp;<strong>Khesari dal/<em>Lathyrus sativus</em>. </strong>(Local names: teora dhal, lak dhal, <strong>batra</strong>, gharas, matra, etc.). When the husk is removed, it&nbsp;looks similar to red gram dal or Bengal gram dal. It is more prevalent in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Bihar.</p>\n<p>In<strong>&nbsp;humans</strong>, it is referred to as&nbsp;<strong>neurolathyrism</strong>&nbsp;because it&nbsp;affects the nervous system. It is&nbsp;characterized by gradually developing spastic&nbsp;paralysis of the lower limbs. In&nbsp;<strong>animals</strong>, it is referred to as&nbsp;<strong>osteolathyrism/odoratism</strong>&nbsp;because the pathological changes in the bones lead to skeletal deformities.&nbsp;It usually affects&nbsp;<strong>young males</strong>&nbsp;aged&nbsp;<strong>15&ndash;45 years</strong>,&nbsp;and it is manifested in stages:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latent stage</li>\n<li>No-stick stage</li>\n<li>One-stick stage</li>\n<li>Two-stick stage</li>\n<li>Crawler stage</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Beta-oxalyl amino alanine (BOAA)</strong>&nbsp;is the toxic compound causing&nbsp;<strong>lathyrism.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vitamin C&nbsp;</strong>in doses of 500&ndash;1000 mg can be used for the prevention and treatment of lathyrism. The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act in India has banned <em>Lathyrus sativus</em> in all forms (whole/split/flour).</p>\n<p><strong>Methods to remove toxin:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Steeping method:</strong> The water-soluble property of the toxin is used in&nbsp;removing it from the pulses by&nbsp;<strong>soaking&nbsp;it in hot water</strong>&nbsp;and rejecting the soaked water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Parboiling</strong>&nbsp;can be used for detoxifying the crop on large-scale operations.&nbsp;Overnight soaking in lime water, followed by boiling, is also effective in destroying the toxin.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Public Education</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Genetic approach:&nbsp;</strong>Selective cultivation and propagation of certain strains of <em>Lathyrus</em>, which contain very low levels of toxin (0.1%).</li>\n<li><strong>Socio-economic changes</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 710\">&nbsp;</div>",

It means to gratify an impulse by changing the end goal from a <strong>socially objectionable</strong> one to a <strong>socially valued one</strong>. Sublimation of <strong>aggressive impulses</strong> generally takes place through <strong>games </strong>or<strong> sports</strong>. Sublimation allows instincts to be channeled and not dammed up or diverted. Hence, in sublimation, feelings are acknowledged, modified, and directed toward a socially valued/acceptable goal so that modest instinctual satisfaction is achieved.\u00a0In the given scenario, the man sublimates his urge to physically harm his boss (socially objectionable) by taking up badminton (socially valued).</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Altruism</strong> is a <strong>mature</strong> defense mechanism. In altruistic defense, the person gratifies an impulse by providing service or help to others even though it can be detrimental to the person itself.\u00a0Example: An alcoholic funding a rehabilitation center even though he may be poor.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Displacement</strong> is a <strong>neurotic</strong> defense mechanism. In displacement, the person carries out purposeful, unconscious shifting of impulses from one object or person to another. Although the object is changed, the <strong>instinctual</strong> <strong>nature</strong> of the impulse and its aim <strong>remain</strong> <strong>unchanged</strong> and this differentiates it from sublimation where the end goal is changed to a socially acceptable one. Example: A person may be angry towards their boss for reprimanding him and wants to abuse his boss by using foul language. Here, the person displaces his anger by being rude and using foul language to his parents at home.\u00a0<br /><br />Option D: <strong>Projection</strong> is an <strong>immature</strong> defense mechanism. On a nonpsychotic level, projection involves attributing one's own unacknowledged feelings to others. At higher levels, it may include misinterpreting motives, attitudes, feelings, or intentions of others.<br />Example: A man wishes to cheat on his wife, instead he says that he is sure his wife is cheating on him.

The classical presentation of BPPV is <strong>recurrent, brief (&lt;1 minute) episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position.</strong>&nbsp;Diagnosis is made by the&nbsp;<strong>Dix-hallpike maneuver.&nbsp;</strong>The therapeutic maneuver is the <strong>Epley maneuver </strong>which <strong>displaces the otolith out of the posterior canal.&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;ends the sensation of vertigo with positional changes relieving the symptoms.

It is usually diagnosed in middle-aged individuals, and no racial or sexual predominance is seen. Patients present with&nbsp;<strong>noise or pressure-induced dizziness</strong>. Some may complain of&nbsp;<strong>chronic imbalance</strong>. As a result, the patient adopts avoidance of noisy environments.

Acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids cause intense pain and perianal mass during the first 24 to 72 hours. Patients who present&nbsp;<strong>within 72 hours</strong>&nbsp;of thrombosis are treated with&nbsp;elliptical <strong>excision</strong> performed under local anesthesia.</p>\n<p>If the patient presents to the hospital&nbsp;<strong>after 72 hours</strong> of thrombosis, then it is treated&nbsp;<strong>conservatively</strong>&nbsp;with analgesics and a sitz bath. Once the symptoms come down, definitive surgery is performed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong> of <strong>internal</strong>&nbsp;hemorrhoids:</p>\n<p><strong>Bleeding</strong> from <strong>grade 1</strong> and <strong>grade 2</strong> hemorrhoids often <strong>improve</strong> with the addition of <strong>dietary fiber,</strong>&nbsp;use of stool softeners, increase in&nbsp;<strong>fluid</strong> intake, and avoidance of straining.</p>\n<p>Grade 1, grade 2,&nbsp;and&nbsp;some grade 3 hemorrhoids with only an internal component&nbsp;can be treated with simple procedures like rubber <strong>band ligation,</strong> <strong>sclerotherapy,</strong> infrared and laser coagulation, and cryotherapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Rubber band ligation</strong> involves pulling the mucosa 1 to 2 cm proximal to the dentate line&nbsp;into a rubber band applier. The rubber band strangulates the underlying tissue, causing scarring and sloping off the mass in a few days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Sclerotherapy</strong> involves injecting 1&nbsp;to 3 mL of a sclerosing solution (phenol in olive oil, sodium morrhuate, or quinine urea) into the submucosa of internal&nbsp;hemorrhoids.</p>\n<p><strong>Indications for surgery</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Internal grade 3 or grade 4 hemorrhoids/grade 2 hemorrhoids not cured by non-operative treatments&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Hemorrhoids with a significant external component</li>\n<li>Early-grade hemorrhoids not responding to simple procedures</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Surgical</strong> <strong>procedures</strong> used in the removal of internal hemorrhoids:</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation</p>\n<p>2)<strong> Open hemorrhoidectomy</strong>: Artery forceps are applied to the skin-covered external components of the hemorrhoid, and traction is used to visualize the internal components. <strong>Dissection</strong> of the <strong>lateral pedicle</strong> is performed and, finally, the pedicles are transfixed. Mucocutaneous bridges are left intact in this technique.&nbsp;The image below shows the procedure.&nbsp;</p>",
