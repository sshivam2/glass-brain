There is no cyclic pain or bluish bulge, as menstruation cannot occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: OHVIRA: Obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly: </strong>Rare condition with an obstructed hemivagina. Often associated with renal anomalies and a functional contralateral uterus, but it presents with cyclic pain later after menarche onset, not primary amenorrhea.</p>",

It usually signifies <strong>mild</strong> to <strong>moderate chronic vascular occlusive disease. </strong>The pain is brought on by walking, not present on taking the first step. Relieved by rest in both the standing and sitting positions, usually within 5 minutes (option A).

Though this pain is present during the day, it is exacerbated on lying down at night due to loss of gravity-dependent perfusion of the foot.

    "solution": "<p>The low FSH and LH levels, along with the low BMI, suggest<strong> hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.</strong></p>\n<p>BMI of 17.5 kg/m\u00b2 indicates low body weight, which can lead to hypothalamic suppression and a disruption in the normal feedback mechanisms that regulate the menstrual cycle. FSH (2mIU/ml), LH (0.3IU/L): These values are low, indicating that the pathology lies at the level of the hypothalamus or pituitary, rather than the ovaries. In hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, there is insufficient secretion of gonadotropins (FSH and LH), which are needed for ovarian function. TSH (1.2mIU/ml) and Prolactin (20 ng/ml) are normal, which rules out thyroid dysfunction or hyperprolactinemia as the cause of the amenorrhea.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong> of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kallman's syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome</li>\n<li>Pituitary tumors, apoplexy</li>\n<li><strong>Anorexia nervosa, excess exercise</strong></li>\n<li>Irradiation, Infection,Trauma</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Exercise-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (EIHG)</strong>: intense and prolonged physical activity leads to a decrease in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, resulting in lower levels of sex hormones. This occurs due to reduced secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which subsequently lowers levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).</p>\n<p><strong>Causes: </strong>Excessive physical training, especially in endurance sports. Energy imbalance (low calorie intake vs. high energy expenditure). Psychological stress and overtraining.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Men: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and muscle weakness.</li>\n<li>Women: Irregular or absent menstrual cycles (amenorrhea).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Management </strong>includes rest and reduced exercise intensity. Adequate caloric intake to correct energy deficits. EIHG is a reversible condition with lifestyle modifications and is most commonly seen in athletes or individuals with excessive physical demands.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Primary ovarian failure </strong>(Premature ovarian insufficiency) is associated with elevated FSH and LH levels due to a lack of negative feedback from the ovaries, which is not the case here (FSH and LH are low).</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism</strong> refers to primary ovarian failure, where <strong>FSH and LH levels </strong>are <strong>elevated</strong> due to the lack of ovarian response. The low levels of FSH and LH here rule out this condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: Normogonadotropic Normogonadism </strong>would indicate<strong> normal levels</strong> of FSH, LH, and estrogen, typically seen in conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
