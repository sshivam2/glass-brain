This is called the Bezold Jarisch reflex and can be elicited by&nbsp;capsaicin, serotonin, phenylbiguanide, and veratridine.

These receptors are stimulated by hyperinflation of the lungs or intravenous administration of capsaicin. The reflex produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia and hypotension. This is called the <strong>J reflex.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option B-<strong> Cushing reflex</strong> is the <strong>increased blood pressure</strong> and <strong>bradycardia</strong> seen in patients with raised intracranial pressure. Increased intracranial pressure compresses the cerebral blood vessels and causes <strong>hypercapnia</strong>. This stimulates the central chemoreceptors located in the ventrolateral surface of the medulla and causes increased blood pressure. This increase is proportional to the increase in the intracranial pressure. Increased blood pressure stimulates baroreceptors and causes bradycardia.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C- <strong>Brainbridge reflex</strong> is the <strong>increase</strong> in the <strong>heart rate</strong> when the atrium is <strong>stretched. </strong>Whenever there is a stretch of the atrium, the stretch receptors are activated. They transmit their afferent signals through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. Efferent signals are then transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase the heart rate and strength of heart contraction. This reflex prevents the accumulation of blood in the atria, veins and pulmonary circulation.</p>",

It presents as sudden-onset <strong>fever, retroorbital pain,</strong> <strong>myalgia, arthralgia</strong>, and a <strong>rash</strong>. The rash in dengue appears as 'white islands in a red sea' due to&nbsp;erythema with petechiae.&nbsp;Demonstration of circulating <strong>IgM antibody</strong> provides early diagnosis as it appears within two to five days of onset of illness and persists for one to three months.</p>\n<p>Dengue is an acute febrile disease caused by the mosquito-borne dengue viruses (DENVs), consisting of four serotypes (DENV 1 to 4), that are members of the <strong>Flaviviridae</strong>&nbsp;family, genus flavivirus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dengue virus is transmitted from person to person by Aedes aegypti or&nbsp;<strong>\"tiger\"</strong>&nbsp;mosquitoes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The four DENV infections can be asymptomatic or manifest. The diseases range in severity from undifferentiated acute febrile illness, <strong>classical dengue fever</strong> (DF), to the life-threatening conditions <strong>Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)/Dengue</strong> <strong>Shock Syndrome (DSS)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After an incubation period of 3&ndash;15 days, classical dengue fever begins with an abrupt onset of high fever. The condition is self-limiting though debilitating with headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, petechiae rash, and leucopenia. A macular-papular recovery rash appears 3&ndash;5 days after the onset of fever, and it usually starts on the trunk before spreading peripherally. During the febrile phase, dehydration can lead to neurological disturbances and febrile seizures in young children. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dengue fever is sometimes referred to as &lsquo;<strong>break bone fever</strong>&rsquo; due to associated severe muscle and joint pain&nbsp;or &lsquo;seven-day fever&rsquo; since the symptoms usually persist for 7 days.</p>\n<p id=\"__p7\"><strong>Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever</strong> or DHF is associated with hemorrhagic manifestations, plasma leakage resulting from an increased vascular permeability, and thrombocytopenia.&nbsp;Plasma leakage is characterized by hemoconcentration (hematocrit increase of 20%), development of ascites, or pleural effusion.</p>\n<p id=\"__p8\"><strong>Dengue Shock Syndrome</strong> is distinguished from Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever by the presence of cardiovascular compromise, which occurs when plasma leakage into the interstitial spaces results&nbsp;<strong>in shock.</strong>&nbsp;DSS is a fatal condition. Common clinical warning signs for DSS include a rapidly rising hematocrit, intense abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, and narrowed or absent blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Suspected cases of dengue are confirmed by the presence of <strong>NS1 antigen or IgM antibodies</strong>. IgG antibodies can be done in paired serum samples.</p>\n<p>The treatment of dengue is supportive management, with&nbsp;hydration, cold sponging, and paracetamol for fever. Aspirin/ NSAIDS like Ibuprofen should be avoided as they can cause gastritis, vomiting, acidosis, platelet dysfunction and severe bleeding. Fluid and electrolyte replacement and platelet infusion should be done for severe cases.&nbsp;</p>",

As a result, HBcAg is&nbsp;<strong>not commonly detectable</strong>&nbsp;in the serum of patients with HBV infection since naked core particles are not found in the bloodstream. Conversely,&nbsp;<strong>anti-HBc</strong>&nbsp;can be detected in the serum shortly after the emergence of HBsAg, usually within&nbsp;<strong>1-2 weeks. Anti-HBc</strong>&nbsp;may be the only&nbsp;<strong>serologic marker</strong>&nbsp;useful for the identification of HBV infection during the&nbsp;<strong>window period.&nbsp;</strong>Initially, the <strong>anti-HBc</strong> is of IgM variety, but in <strong>chronic infections</strong>, it is of <strong>IgG class</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>HBeAg</strong>&nbsp;appears shortly after the appearance of HBsAg. Its appearance correlates with high levels of&nbsp;<strong>virus replication. Anti-HBe</strong>&nbsp;correlates with a period of&nbsp;<strong>lower infectivity.&nbsp;</strong>In <strong>chronic active hepatitis</strong>, <strong>HBeAg</strong> <strong>persists</strong> and <strong>anti-HBe</strong> <strong>does</strong> <strong>not</strong> <strong>appear</strong>.</p>",

Atropine is the anticholinergic active principle derived from tropane alkaloids such as Datura stramonium and Atropa belladonna. Toxidrome consists of features such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, agitation, delirium, mydriasis, dry flushed skin, and urinary retention. Physostigmine is a reversible acetylcholine esterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine concentrations in the synaptic cleft to mitigate the effects of atropine toxicity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Atropine</strong> is used in the<strong> treatment of cholinergic toxicity due to organophosphates (DDT, parathion, malathion)</strong>. Symptoms of cholinergic toxicity include bradycardia, respiratory depression, and autonomic symptoms of salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation. Atropine used in association with pralidoxime act as competitive inhibitors at the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to neutralize the toxicity.</p>",
