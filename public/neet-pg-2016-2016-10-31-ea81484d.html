As fasting progresses, the body adapts to spare protein by decreasing the rate of gluconeogenesis. While gluconeogenesis remains active to supply glucose for glucose-dependent tissues, the overall rate doesn't increase because peripheral tissues decrease their glucose demands.

    "solution": "<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <strong>A</strong>. <strong>cAMP</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Cholera toxin mediates its effects through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as the second messenger. The toxin consists of A and B subunits, where the B subunit binds to GM1 ganglioside receptors on intestinal epithelial cells, allowing the entry of the A subunit. Once inside the cell, fragment A activates adenylate cyclase, resulting in increased intracellular cAMP levels. Elevated cAMP then activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates the CFTR chloride channels, leading to massive secretion of chloride ions and water into the intestinal lumen while inhibiting sodium absorption. This mechanism is responsible for the characteristic profuse watery diarrhea seen in cholera.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Option B. cGMP</strong> - This is incorrect because cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is not the primary second messenger involved in cholera toxin's mechanism of action. While cGMP is an important second messenger in other systems (particularly in smooth muscle relaxation and visual signal transduction), it is not the pathway utilized by cholera toxin.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Option C. Ca\u00b2\u207a-calmodulin</strong> - This is incorrect because calcium-calmodulin signaling is not the primary mechanism used by cholera toxin. Calcium as a second messenger is involved in many cellular processes including muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release, but cholera toxin specifically targets the cAMP pathway.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Option D. IP3/DAG</strong> - This is incorrect because inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) signaling pathway is not utilized by cholera toxin. The IP3/DAG pathway is typically activated by G protein-coupled receptors linked to phospholipase C, resulting in calcium release from intracellular stores, but this is not how cholera toxin exerts its effects.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cholera toxin causes profuse secretory diarrhea by increasing intracellular cAMP levels through ADP-ribosylation of G proteins, which leads to constitutive activation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent massive fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen.</span></p>",

In cases of disseminated nocardiosis, the brain is the most common site of extrapulmonary infection. Nocardia species, including N. asteroides, initially cause pulmonary infection in most cases, but then can spread hematogenously to distant sites.

This legal provision exists to protect the privacy, dignity, and safety of sexual assault survivors.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Option A (Section 292A)</strong>: This section does not relate to protecting rape victim identities.

These sections address the criminal act rather than the protection of victim identity.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Option D (Section 225A)</strong>: This section is not related to rape victims or identity protection.

Smegma is a thick, cheesy secretion that accumulates under the prepuce and around the corona glandis. This substance gets rubbed off during sexual intercourse and takes approximately 24 hours to redeposit.

Neuroectoderm is a specialized portion of ectoderm that forms the neural tube and neural crest. The neural tube gives rise to the central nervous system, including neurons and neuroglial cells.

The radial nerve supplies all the extensor muscles of the wrist and fingers. When damaged, patients lose the ability to extend the wrist, leading to the characteristic \"wrist drop\" appearance.

When the knee is in full extension, the femur undergoes Medial rotation in relation to the tibia (known as the \"screw-home mechanism\"), which locks the knee joint in place for stability during standing. The popliteus muscle initiates knee flexion by first rotating the femur laterally to unlock this mechanism. This unlocking action is essential before the hamstring muscles can effectively flex the knee joint.

In this case, the woman engages in repetitive handwashing (compulsion) likely in response to obsessive thoughts about contamination. Response Prevention involves preventing the person from performing the compulsive behavior (handwashing) when they feel the urge. This breaks the reinforcement cycle where the anxiety reduction from performing the compulsion reinforces the behavior. When used together with Exposure therapy, it forms \"Exposure and Response Prevention\" (ERP), which is the first-line psychotherapeutic treatment for OCD.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Hence, if we have to pick between exposure and response prevention, the response prevention becomes the better answer.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Thought Stopping (Incorrect)</strong>: Thought stopping is a technique where the patient attempts to interrupt unwanted thoughts, often using distraction or verbal commands. While sometimes used in cognitive therapy, it's not considered highly effective for OCD treatment and is not the first-line approach for compulsive behaviors.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Desensitization (Incorrect)</strong>: Systematic desensitization involves gradually exposing patients to anxiety-provoking stimuli while they are in a relaxed state. While useful for specific phobias, it is not the primary technique for treating compulsive behaviors in OCD.

During the first few weeks of life, GFR increases dramatically, reaching approximately 50% of adult values by 1-2 weeks of age. By 1-2 years of age, the GFR reaches adult levels of approximately 100-120 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2.

The effectiveness of these combinations can vary.

ARB (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker) + Thiazide:\u00a0</strong>Similar to ACE inhibitors, ARBs also block the renin-angiotensin system, leading to a strong synergistic effect when combined with thiazide diuretics. This is also a highly effective and recommended combination.</li><li><strong>D. Calcium Channel Blocker + Thiazide:\u00a0</strong>This is also a very effective combination. Calcium channel blockers cause vasodilation, and thiazides reduce fluid volume.

It belongs to the ultra-long acting insulin category along with insulin detemir and degludec. These insulins provide steady basal insulin levels, significantly reducing hypoglycemia risk.

NPH Insulin:</strong> As an intermediate-acting insulin, NPH demonstrates a definite peak at 8-10 hours post-administration. Its duration spans 12-20 hours, making it far from \"peakless\" in its activity profile.</li><li><strong>Option D.
