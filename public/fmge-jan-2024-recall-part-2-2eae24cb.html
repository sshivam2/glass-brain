It <strong>relies</strong> on the <strong>patient's</strong> <strong>ability</strong> to initiate and maintain breathing efforts while receiving pressure support from the device. An <strong>unconscious patient,</strong> by definition, <strong>lacks</strong> the <strong>ability</strong> to consciously control their breathing and cannot actively participate in the breathing process. Therefore, <strong>BiPAP</strong> <strong>therapy</strong> is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in <strong>unconscious</strong> <strong>patients</strong> as they cannot tolerate the interface and settings required for this type of ventilation.</p>\n<p>In such cases,<strong> invasive mechanical ventilation,</strong> which provides full ventilatory support, is typically necessary to maintain adequate gas exchange and support respiratory function.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(a) Low pO2 levels: </strong>BiPAP therapy is often utilized to improve oxygenation in patients with hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels). By delivering positive airway pressure, BiPAP helps to recruit collapsed alveoli, improve lung ventilation-perfusion matching, and enhance oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream. Therefore, low pO2 levels are not a contraindication for BiPAP therapy; instead, they may indicate the need for BiPAP to support oxygenation.</p>\n<p><strong>(c) High CO2 levels: </strong>BiPAP therapy can also be beneficial for patients with hypercapnia (elevated blood carbon dioxide levels), such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or obesity hypoventilation syndrome. By providing inspiratory pressure support and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), BiPAP assists ventilation, enhances alveolar ventilation, and helps to eliminate excess carbon dioxide from the body. Therefore, high CO2 levels alone do not contraindicate the use of BiPAP therapy; rather, BiPAP may be indicated to improve ventilation and reduce CO2 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>(d) Obstructive sleep apnea: </strong>BiPAP therapy is commonly employed as a non-invasive treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway collapse during sleep. By delivering two levels of pressure \u2013 higher pressure during inspiration (IPAP) and lower pressure during expiration (EPAP) \u2013 BiPAP helps to keep the upper airway open, prevent apnea events, and improve sleep quality. Therefore, obstructive sleep apnea is not a contraindication for BiPAP therapy; rather, BiPAP is a recommended treatment modality for managing this condition.</p>",

Serum lipase is more sensitive and specific than serum amylase but it rises late. USG cannot help establish the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Plain <strong>erect chest x-ray</strong> and <strong>abdominal radiographs</strong> are <strong>not diagnostic </strong>of acute pancreatitis and can only be used to rule out certain differentials. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (<strong>CECT</strong>) is the <strong>imaging investigation of choice, </strong>but may not always be needed. Various scoring systems are used to grade the severity of acute pancreatitis based on blood investigations and radiographic findings.</p>\n<p><strong>Management:</strong></p>\n<p>In the management of acute pancreatitis, it's crucial to avoid stimulating the pancreas further, as it can exacerbate inflammation and worsen symptoms. <strong>Therefore, solutions containing glucose, such as 5% dextrose, should be avoided because they can trigger pancreatic enzyme secretion. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>5% Dextrose is also a hypotonic solution and cannot maintain plasma oncotic pressure and will exaggerate the underlying third space loss.</strong></p>\n<p>Instead, fluids should be administered intravenously as necessary, but they should be non-stimulating to the pancreas, such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Early initiation of oral feedings</strong> is also not recommended in the acute phase of pancreatitis because it can lead to increased pancreatic stimulation and exacerbation of symptoms. Oral intake should be avoided until the patient's condition improves and pancreatic enzyme levels normalize.</p>\n<p><strong>Parenteral nutrition</strong> may be considered in severe cases of acute pancreatitis or when oral intake cannot be resumed within a few days. However, it is not universally preferred for all patients, and the decision to initiate parenteral nutrition should be based on the patient's clinical status, nutritional needs, and response to other management strategies.<br />\u00a0</p>",
