Hence <strong>fat-soluble drugs</strong> should be administered based on the <strong>total body weight.</strong> Water-soluble agents like neuromuscular blockers have a smaller peripheral distribution that is minimally increased by body fat. Therefore, <strong>water-soluble agents</strong> are dosed based on the <strong>ideal body weight</strong>.</p>\n<p>Among the commonly used inhalational anesthetics, <strong>desflurane</strong> is the <strong>least fat-soluble</strong> which leads to a faster recovery. <strong>Desflurane</strong> is also <strong>minimally metabolized</strong> by the liver, thereby reducing hepatotoxicity.\u00a0</p>\n<table style=\"width: 635px; height: 197px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 184.953px; text-align: center;\">Inhalational agent</td>\n<td style=\"width: 230.094px; text-align: center;\">Blood-gas partition coefficient</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 184.953px; text-align: center;\">Halothane</td>\n<td style=\"width: 230.094px; text-align: center;\">2.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 184.953px; text-align: center;\">Isoflurane</td>\n<td style=\"width: 230.094px; text-align: center;\">1.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 184.953px; text-align: center;\">Sevoflurane</td>\n<td style=\"width: 230.094px; text-align: center;\">0.65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 184.953px; text-align: center;\">Desflurane</td>\n<td style=\"width: 230.094px; text-align: center;\">0.45</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Blood-gas partition co-efficient</strong> determines the <strong>solubility</strong> of the anesthetic agent in the blood.

    "solution": "<p>The above clinical scenario is suggestive of<strong> Scleroderma-associated pulmonary hypertension.</strong> In PH, there is an <strong>intimal thickening of the pulmonary arteries</strong>, which leads to narrowing of the arteries and increased resistance to blood flow: leading to chest pain, dyspnea on exertion and when severe, hemoptysis.</p>\n<p>Right ventricular dysfunction occurs with the progression of the disease -syncope, abdominal distention, ascites, and peripheral oedema.<br />Pulmonary vasculature may have <strong>intimal proliferation, fibrosis, and in situ thrombosis</strong>. There may be <strong>vascular remodelling</strong> at late stages. These changes increase <strong>right ventricular afterload and total pulmonary vascular resistance</strong>.
