In these patients, an<strong> early fasciotomy </strong>is <strong>preferred</strong> over a late fasciotomy as it can decompress muscle compartments and thereby reduce the need for amputation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A <strong>late fasciotomy </strong>can lead to a <strong>massive release</strong> of<strong> myoglobin</strong> and also lead to infection of the dead tissue. It is best not to perform fasciotomy where the patient has been entrapped for more than 12 hours as muscles of the compartment are likely to be dead and can lead to massive release of vasoactive mediators during debridement.</p>\n<p>Crush syndrome occurs due to <strong>prolonged compression</strong> of a limb leading to <strong>myonecrosis</strong> and decreased perfusion.
