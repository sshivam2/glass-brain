It is caused by mutations in genes that are expressed in Schwann cells.</p>\n<p>Patients present in the&nbsp;first to third decade of life. Early complaints include frequent sprained ankles due to distal muscle weakness and difficulty in running. Footdrop, pes cavus, distal lower muscle atrophy, and areflexia are the physical findings seen. Due to the distal calf muscle atrophy, inverted champagne bottle legs or stork leg deformity is seen. Although the patients do not complain of sensory loss, reduced sensation to all modalities is seen on&nbsp;examination.</p>\n<p>CMT1A: Most common subtype of CMT1. It is caused by a duplication or point mutation on<em> PMP22</em> gene on chromosome 17. Duplication leads to three copies of the <em>PMP22</em> gene, whereas point mutation alters the distribution of the protein.</p>\n<p>CMT1B: also known as peroneal muscular atrophy is caused by point mutations in the gene encoding myelin protein zero (<em>MPZ</em>) on chromosome 1. Myelin protein zero is normally expressed on the cell membrane of Schwann cells, and it plays a major role in myelin membrane adhesion.

It is classified under CMT3. It is characterized by delayed motor development, prominent sensory loss, and distal weakness, followed by proximal weakness and absent reflexes. The nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) are typically slowed to &le;10 m/sec. Scoliosis and contractures progressively develop over time.</p>\n<p>Option B: Dejerine&ndash;Roussy syndrome, also known as thalamic pain syndrome, arises due to the occlusion of the thalamic and thalamogeniculate branches of the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). It is characterized by contralateral&nbsp;hemisensory loss, which starts as numbness and progresses to cause severe burning pain in the affected regions. This pain responds very poorly to analgesics. Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or gabapentin or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may be beneficial.</p>\n<p>Option D: Cowchock syndrome is a form of infantile-onset axonal X-linked CMT presenting with deafness and mental retardation in males. It is caused by mutations in the apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 1 (<em>AIFM1</em>) gene. Females have only minor abnormalities.</p>",
