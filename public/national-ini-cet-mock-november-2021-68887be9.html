Before performing massage the doctor should always auscultate to check for the presence of <strong>carotid bruit</strong>. If bruit is present, it should not be performed. The area of the carotid sinus, at the artery&rsquo;s bifurcation, is palpated with two fingers at the angle of the jaw until a good pulse is felt. A minimal amount of pressure is applied over the carotid sinus. If there is no effect, a side-to-side or rotating motion of the fingers over the site is performed for up to 5 seconds. ECG should be performed to assess the response.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism</strong></p>\n<p>Pressure over the carotid sinus stimulates the baroreceptors. These&nbsp;signals are transmitted through small <strong>Hering&rsquo;s nerves</strong> to the <strong>glossopharyngeal nerves</strong> and then to the <strong>nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)</strong> in the medulla.
