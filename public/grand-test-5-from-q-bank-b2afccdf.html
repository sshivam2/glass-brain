It is seen in children. The first episode is managed by digital reposition. If there is a recurrence, then Theirsch's wiring or sclerotherapy is done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2)<strong>&nbsp;Complete rectal prolapse</strong>- in this type, all the layers of the rectum are prolapsed. It is seen in adults due to the weakening of the pelvic floor. It is managed by using the following approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The perineal approach</strong>- it is easy to perform, has fewer complications but a high recurrence rate. It is preferred in elderly patients with comorbidities. The surgeries done using this approach for rectal prolapse are the following:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thiersch's wiring</strong>- a steel wire/silastic/nylon tape, is placed around the anal canal. Largely obsolete now due to problems with chronic perineal sepsis, anal stenosis, and obstructed defaecation. This procedure is rarely used now.</li>\n<li><strong>Delorme's mucosectomy</strong>- in this procedure, the rectal mucosa is stripped circumferentially from the rectum over the length of the prolapse.&nbsp;The underlying muscle is plicated with a series of sutures. The excess rectal mucosa is excised and a mucosal anastomosis is performed.</li>\n<li><strong>Altemeier's rectosigmoidoscopy</strong>- in&nbsp;this procedure, the rectum is prolapsed through the anal canal and a full-thickness resection is performed, incorporating any associated colonic prolapse. Restoration of colorectal continuity can be performed by hand-sewn/stapled anastomosis.
