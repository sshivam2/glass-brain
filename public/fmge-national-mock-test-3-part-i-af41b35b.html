The most important species that are pathologic to humans are <strong>B.melitensis, B. suis,&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> B.abortus.</strong></p>\n<p>Brucellosis is a <strong>zoonosis</strong>. It is transmitted to humans from contact with or consumption of contaminated products from goats, sheep, cattle, buffaloes, pigs, and other animals.</p>\n<p>Once the infection is transmitted, these bacteria&nbsp;resist intracellular digestion and proliferate within the&nbsp;<strong>reticuloendothelial</strong> system for a long time. This is the reason why brucellosis often becomes chronic and is resistant to simple antimicrobial therapy. The host immune response is mainly cell-mediated involving activated macrophages, helper T-cells, and mediators such as TNF alpha, TNF gamma, IL-1, and IL-12.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clinically, patients may present with an acute infection comprised of <strong>undulant fever, </strong>as in this patient, characterized by a rising and falling fever.

The medium is inoculated with the specimen and incubated for four days in an upright position. Serial subcultures can be obtained by slanting the broth over the agar periodically to inoculate new colonies.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Serological methods include <strong>standard agglutination test</strong> (SAT),&nbsp;<strong>complement fixation test,</strong><strong>Coomb&rsquo;s antiglobulin test</strong>, and <strong>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</strong> (ELISA). Cut-offs for significant titers are variable depending on the endemicity.

If the sample contains antibodies to brucella antigens, agglutination occurs with the agglutinate rising to the top as a<strong> blue ring</strong>. If&nbsp;the sample does not contain antibodies to brucella antigens, the whole of the sample is uniformly stained blue.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment includes antimicrobial therapy with at least two agents for six weeks duration.
