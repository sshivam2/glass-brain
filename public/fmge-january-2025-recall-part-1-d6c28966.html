Ingestion of<strong> \u226525g</strong> can be fatal. Cytochrome <strong>P450 CYP2E1</strong> metabolizes acetaminophen to a <strong>toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI)</strong>. NAPQI is normally neutralized through conjugation with a reduced form of glutathione(GSH), after which it is excreted in the urine. When glutathione reserves are depleted or large amounts of NAPQI are formed, it binds to hepatocyte macromolecules. This can then lead to hepatocyte necrosis.</p>\n<p>N-acetylcysteine <strong>repletes GSH</strong> stores and also conjugates with NAPQI and prevents oxidative damage to the cell. It also protects against <strong>extrahepatic injury</strong> due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Early manifestations</strong> of acetaminophen toxicity(within 4-12 hours) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Later, <strong>renal failure</strong> and <strong>myocardial injury</strong> may be seen. Low bilirubin levels along with raised aminotransferase levels are characteristic of the condition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Initial management includes <strong>gastric lavage</strong> and <strong>oral charcoal</strong> or <strong>cholestyramine.</strong> It should be carried out within <strong>thirty minutes</strong> of ingestion. If they are used, gastric lavage must be done afterwards before using another agent. Acetaminophen blood levels can be estimated from a nomogram plot. In patients with high acetaminophen levels, intravenous N-acetylcysteine administration within<strong> 8 hours of ingestion </strong>is recommended. It helps in the replenishment of glutathione. It is partially effective even up to 36 hours. Liver transplantation is necessary if signs of hepatic failure continue despite therapy.\u00a0</p>",

It usually appears within the<strong> first 24 hours </strong>of life in <strong>neonates</strong> with <strong>hemolytic disease</strong> (e.g., Rh or ABO incompatibility, G6PD deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis). Unlike physiological jaundice, which appears after 24\u201348 hours, <strong>hemolytic jaundice</strong> is<strong> earlier </strong>in <strong>onset</strong> and may require intervention such as phototherapy or exchange transfusion.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Breastmilk jaundice</strong> is due to significant <strong>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia,</strong> <strong>after the 7th day </strong>and may last for 2\u20133 weeks. This may be caused by the breast milk that might contain <strong>\u03b2-glucuronidase,</strong> which deconjugates intestinal bilirubin and promotes its absorption and other inhibitors of glucuronyl transferase. Persistently high bilirubin levels may require changing from breast milk to infant formula for 24\u201348 h and/or treatment with phototherapy, without cessation of breastfeeding.\u00a0</p>",

One of the most common types is <strong>phosphorylation</strong>, where a phosphate group is added to a protein, typically by a kinase, leading to activation or inhibition of the target enzyme.</p>\n<p>Conversely, <strong>dephosphorylation,</strong> catalyzed by phosphatases, removes the phosphate group, reversing the effect. This dynamic process plays a crucial role in <strong>cell signalling, metabolism,</strong> and<strong> gene regulation</strong>. For example, in glycogen metabolism, glycogen phosphorylase is activated by phosphorylation to promote glycogen breakdown, while glycogen synthase is inactivated by phosphorylation to stop glycogen synthesis. These modifications ensure rapid and reversible control of cellular functions in response to physiological needs.</p>\n<p>A few enzyme covalent modifications that regulate enzyme kinetics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Partial proteolysis</li>\n<li>Acetylation</li>\n<li>Methylation</li>\n<li>ADP-ribosylation</li>\n<li><strong>Phosphorylation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Competitive inhibition</strong> is a type of inhibition that occurs when the inhibitor binds<strong> reversibly</strong> to the same site that the<strong> substrate</strong> would normally occupy.

This regulatory mechanism is crucial for <strong>feedback control</strong> in metabolic pathways.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Noncompetitive inhibition</strong> is by binding of inhibitors to enzymes in locations <strong>remote</strong> from the active site. Increasing the concentration of the substrate<strong> does not overcom</strong>e non-competitive inhibition.

    "solution": "<p><strong>Phosphine</strong> causes <strong>histotoxic hypoxia </strong>by<strong> inhibiting mitochondrial function and disrupting cellular respiration </strong>at the tissue level.</p>\n<p>Phosphine causes histotoxic hypoxia, and thus, by preventing the O2 utilization at the tissue level, it acts as a powerful stimulus for peripheral chemoreceptors. Phosphine inhibits <strong>cytochrome oxidase (Complex IV)</strong> in the <strong>electron transport chain. This disrupts oxidative phosphorylation, preventing ATP production despite adequate oxygen availability.</strong></p>\n<p>In phosphine poisoning the <strong>oxygen is present</strong> but <strong>cells cannot use it due to blocked cellular respiration</strong>. This is why <strong>simple oxygen supplementation isn't effective as a primary treatment</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Anemic hypoxia</strong> occurs due to<strong> decreased hemoglobin</strong> in the blood capable of carrying oxygen. This can be in the form of a low amount of hemoglobin, defective hemoglobin, or interference with <strong>hemoglobin-oxygen binding. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning </strong>is classified as anemic hypoxia as CO preferentially binds to hemoglobin and reduces the oxygen binding. Treatment involves terminating the exposure to CO and oxygen supplementation.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: Hypoxic hypoxia</strong> refers to a<strong> reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood</strong>. It has multiple causes, like <strong>high altitude, hypoventilation, right-to-left shunts,</strong> diffusion defects, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Chronic emphysema is an example of hypoxic hypoxia, as there is alveolar destruction leading to reduced gas exchange and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In most cases, supplemental oxygen is helpful in treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: Stagnant hypoxia</strong> refers to ischemic hypoxia that results from <strong>inadequate circulation</strong> due to conditions such as <strong>heart failure</strong> and <strong>hypoxia</strong> in the setting of shock. In such conditions, administering intravenous fluids can improve the patient's condition because it is the circulation that is affected. If the shock is prolonged it can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be treated with<strong> positive pressure ventilation </strong>and not simply by increasing oxygen administration.</p>",
