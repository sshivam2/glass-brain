    "solution": "<p>Flooding is not a part of systematic desensitization.</p>\n<p><strong>Systematic desensitization&nbsp;</strong>is based on the behavioral principle of <strong>counterconditioning</strong> and was developed by Joseph Wolpe. Counterconditioning involves a <strong>gradual approach</strong> to a <strong>feared situation</strong>, in a psychophysiological state that inhibits anxiety, to overcome the maladaptive anxiety elicited by that situation. It works best in cases of a clearly identifiable anxiety-provoking stimulus. It has been successfully used in the treatment of phobias, obsessions, compulsions, and certain sexual disorders.</p>\n<p>It consists of three steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relaxation training</strong> - Patients attain a state of complete relaxation and are then exposed to the stimulus that elicits the anxiety response. Relaxation methods like <strong>yoga</strong>, <strong>progressive relaxation</strong>, <strong>hypnosis</strong>, and <strong>mental imagery</strong> can be used. The physiological changes during the relaxation process; slow heart rate, increased peripheral blood flow, and neuromuscular stability; are opposite to that of the adrenergic response invoked during anxiety. The relaxed state inhibits the negative reaction of anxiety associated with the phobia and this is known as <strong>reciprocal inhibition</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Hierarchy construction&nbsp;</strong>- The therapist determines all the conditions that elicit anxiety and the patients prepare a <strong>graded list or hierarchy</strong> of 10-12 fear-provoking scenes in the order of increasing anxiety.</li>\n<li><strong>Desensitization of the stimulus&nbsp;</strong>- Patients proceed systematically through the list from the least to the most anxiety-provoking scene while in a deeply relaxed state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Flooding</strong>&nbsp;involves repeated and prolonged exposure to fear cues of high intensity<strong>&nbsp;without</strong>&nbsp;a<strong>&nbsp;hierarchy</strong>. It is based on the premise that anxiety gets reinforced by conditioning when the patient escapes from the anxiety-provoking situation. Patients are encouraged to face the feared situations directly and are prevented from escaping. There is <strong>no gradual build-up</strong> or use of relaxation techniques.</p>\n<p>Phobia refers to&nbsp;<strong>excessive fear</strong>&nbsp;of a specific circumstance, situation, or object. A&nbsp;<strong>specific phobia</strong>&nbsp;is a strong and per&shy;sisting fear of a particular situation or an object.&nbsp;<strong>Exposure</strong>&nbsp;or<strong>&nbsp;anticipation</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>contact</strong>&nbsp;with the situation/object triggers an&nbsp;<strong>anxiety reaction</strong>. This inadvertently leads to&nbsp;<strong>panic attacks</strong> in people who are susceptible. The person goes to great lengths to avoid this situation or object. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5), &nbsp;phobias are classified under&nbsp;<strong>Anxiety disorders</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Behavior therapy</strong> is considered the <strong>most effective</strong> treatment for phobias. Systemic desensitization is the most common behavior therapy used for phobias. Other modes of treatment of phobias include insight-oriented psychotherapy, virtual therapy, hypnosis, and family therapy.</p>",

Examination reveals bisferiens carotid pulse. A fourth heart sound and variable systolic murmur can be auscultated. It is an inherited autosomal disease with variable penetrance. They are caused by mutation of the gene encoding for myosin heavy chains or proteins regulating calcium handling. The <strong>echocardiogram</strong> is the diagnostic tool. Any area of left ventricle thickness <strong>more than 1.5 cm</strong> confirms the disease.</p>\n<p>Option D:\u00a0<strong>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</strong> presents as acute anterior myocardial infarction, with acute chest pain or shortness of breath. It occurs soon after a high catecholamine surge and is seen predominantly in postmenopausal women.\u00a0 Cardiac catheterization shows normal coronaries.

In the cytoplasmic region, these receptors have a &ldquo;death domain.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><strong>Fas ligand (FasL)</strong>&nbsp;is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T-lymphocytes. Fas-FasL interactions are required for thymic medullary negative selection.

    "solution": "<p>The case described with fever, earache, erythematous, and bulging tympanic membrane points to a diagnosis of <strong>acute suppurative otitis media</strong> (ASOM), which is treated by antibiotics and incision of the tympanic membrane using a<strong> myringotome (myringotomy).</strong></p>\n<p>Treatment is with <strong>antibiotics</strong>, and <strong>supportive therapy</strong> like nasal decongestants, antipyretics, ear toilet, and dry heat. Myringotomy is the incision of the tympanic membrane using a sharp myringotome, to evacuate pus. It is indicated in ASOM when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tympanic membrane is <strong>bulging</strong> with <strong>severe pain</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Persistent conductive hearing loss</strong> despite antibiotics</li>\n<li><strong>Persistent effusion</strong> beyond 12 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Complications</strong> like facial paralysis, labyrinthitis, or meningitis with bulging tympanic membrane arise.</li>\n<li><strong>Recurrent</strong> acute otitis media</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ASOM is an acute inflammation of the middle ear by pyogenic organisms. The disease usually follows a viral upper respiratory tract infection and occurs in the following stages:</p>\n<p>1. Stage of <strong>tubal occlusion</strong>: Eustachian tube gets blocked with retraction of the tympanic membrane and effusion in the middle ear. However, fluid may not be clinically visible. Patients present with mild deafness and earache, but no fever. Tuning fork tests show conductive deafness.</p>\n<p>2. Stage of <strong>presuppuration</strong>: Prolonged tubal occlusion leads to pyogenic infection of the tympanic cavity. The tympanic membrane becomes congested with a leash of blood vessels along the handle of the malleus and at the periphery of the tympanic membrane (<strong>cart-wheel appearance</strong>). Tuning fork tests show conductive hearing loss. Patients present with throbbing earache, deafness, tinnitus, and fever.</p>\n<p>3. Stage of<strong> suppuration:</strong>&nbsp;Formation of pus in the middle ear, with <strong>bulging tympanic membrane </strong>and<strong> loss of landmarks</strong>. A yellow spot may be seen where a rupture might occur.&nbsp;Tenderness may be elicited over the mastoid antrum. Patients present with severe earache, increasing deafness and fever of 102&ndash;103 &deg;F, vomiting, and even convulsions.<br /><br />4. Stage of <strong>resolution:</strong>&nbsp;The tympanic <strong>membrane ruptures</strong> with the release of pus and <strong>symptoms subside</strong>. A&nbsp;small perforation is seen in the anteroinferior quadrant of pars tensa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. Stage of <strong>complications</strong>: Acute mastoiditis, subperiosteal abscess, facial paralysis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, extradural abscess, meningitis, brain abscess, or lateral sinus thrombophlebitis may develop.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Lempert&rsquo;s curette</strong>&nbsp;(scoop) is used&nbsp;in mastoid surgery for the removal of bony septa and granulations.</p>",
