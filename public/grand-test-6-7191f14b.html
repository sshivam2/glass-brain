Note that this will be <strong>seen in both primary and secondary</strong> adrenal insufficiency.</p>\n<p>Adrenal insufficiency can be divided into:</p>\n<p><strong>Primary adrenal insufficiency</strong> <strong>(Addison's disease)</strong> is most commonly due to <strong>autoimmune adrenalitis</strong>.

    "solution": "<p>The <strong>most appropriate time for orchidopexy</strong> is between <strong>6 to 18 months </strong>of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Orchidopexy</strong> is the <strong>surgery of choice</strong> for <strong>undescended testes</strong>. It is done in order to <strong>prevent the complications</strong> that might occur if the testes continue to remain inside the abdomen, such as <strong>infertility</strong> and the<strong> risk of malignancy</strong>. The surgery is usually <strong>performed between the ages of 6 months to 18 months.</strong> The testes and the spermatic cord are mobilized, the fibrous adhesions around the deep ring are divided, and the <strong>testes are repositioned</strong> in the scrotum, in a <strong>pouch constructed</strong> <strong>between</strong> the <strong>dartos muscle</strong> <strong>and</strong> the <strong>skin</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cryptorchidism</strong> refers to the <strong>incomplete descent of the testes</strong>, <strong>but in their normal path </strong>from the abdomen to the scrotum. <strong>If</strong> they <strong>lie outside</strong> the <strong>normal path</strong>, they are referred to as <strong>ectopic testes</strong>. The occurrence of <strong>cryptorchidism</strong> is more common in <strong>premature infants</strong>. In two-thirds of the cases, the testes will reach the scrotum by 3 months of life; full descent after this time is unlikely. The descent of the testes may be arrested in any of the following positions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abdominal (15%)</li>\n<li>Inguinal (25%)</li>\n<li><strong>High up in the scrotum (60%)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">Undescended testes can give rise to a number of more <strong>serious consequences</strong>. This includes <strong>infertility</strong>, <strong>testicular malignancy</strong>, and <strong>testicular torsion.</strong> By the second year of life, there is a significant degeneration of the spermatogenic tissue. An <strong>orchidopexy done during adulthood (after puberty)</strong> will result in <strong>no significant fertility benefits</strong> and <strong>no reduction in the risk of testicular malignancy</strong>. Therefore, <strong>orchidopexy should be done as early as possible within the recommended age </strong>to prevent the occurrence of these complications.&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">One important <strong>differential</strong> to be considered in these patients is <strong>retractile testis</strong>. Because of the strong cremasteric reflex, the stimulation of the scrotal skin causes the testis to ascend upwards and disappear into the inguinal canal. If it is a case of <strong>retractile testis</strong>, the <strong>scrotal skin will be well developed</strong>, in contrast to the <strong>underdeveloped scrotal skin seen in cryptorchidism</strong>. Further, the retractile testis that has ascended into the inguinal canal can be gently milked downwards, but this is not the case with true undescended testis.</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">In <strong>most cases</strong> of cryptorchidism, the <strong>testis can be palpated in the inguinal region </strong>and thus local exploration and orchidopexy can be done. In cases when the testis is not palpable, <strong>ultrasound</strong> and <strong>laparoscopy</strong> are done <strong>to pinpoint the location of the testis </strong>and plan further management. The diagnostic and treatment algorithm is given below.</div>",

Subsequently, additional enzymes produced in activated neutrophils, like myeloperoxidase (MPO) and elastase, penetrate the nucleus and induce further chromatin relaxation. This process eventually leads to the disruption of the nuclear membrane and the release of chromatin.</p>\n<p>NETs\u00a0are <strong>networks </strong>of <strong>extracellular fibers</strong>\u00a0that consist of a viscous meshwork of nuclear chromatin. They\u00a0<strong>trap microbes</strong> at sites of infection, preventing their further spread. They also\u00a0contain a high concentration of <strong>antimicrobial proteins</strong> like neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and histones that have a high affinity for DNA.</p>\n<p>They are <strong>produced by neutrophils</strong> in response to the following triggers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pathogens\u00a0</strong>- <strong>Mainly bacteria and fungi</strong></li>\n<li>Inflammatory mediators<strong> -</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Chemokines</li>\n<li>Cytokines (mainly interferons)</li>\n<li>Complement proteins</li>\n<li>Reactive oxygen species</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NETs have also been detected in the blood during <strong>sepsis.</strong> In this condition,<strong> platelet activation</strong> is involved in the NET formation.

This oxidase facilitates the conversion of <strong>oxygen into superoxide anions.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: Nuclear alterations in necrosis occur due to the degradation of DNA.

It involves prolapsing the rectum through the anal canal, followed by <strong>full-thickness resection of the rectum</strong>. Following this, colorectal continuity is established by stapled or hand-sewn anastomosis.

Depending on the layers which protrude out, it can be divided as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <strong>partial rectal prolapse,\u00a0</strong>only the <strong>mucosal layer</strong> of the rectum is <strong>prolapsed</strong>. It is often seen in <strong>children</strong>. The first episode is <strong>managed by digital repositioning</strong>.

Perineal approaches include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thiersch's procedure </strong>involves the<strong> placement of\u00a0a steel wire/nylon tape</strong>, is placed around the anal canal. This is rarely done now because it is associated with chronic perineal infection and stenosis of the anal canal.</li>\n<li><strong>Delorme's procedure </strong>involves circumferential <strong>stripping of the\u00a0mucosa</strong> from the rectum throughout the length of the prolapse.\u00a0The underlying <strong>muscle</strong> is then <strong>plicated</strong> with a series of sutures. The excess rectal mucosa is excised and a mucosal anastomosis is performed.</li>\n<li><strong>Altemeier's procedure </strong>has already been described above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Abdominal operations </strong>can be laparoscopic or open. They are associated with a <strong>higher risk of damage to the pelvic autonomic nerves</strong>, causing <strong>sexual dysfunction</strong>. Thus, perineal approaches are preferred in young patients.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anterior mesh rectopexy</strong> / <strong>Ripstein's procedure</strong> involves the suturing of a prosthetic mesh to the anterior part of the rectum and sacral promontory.\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Posterior mesh rectopexy</strong> / <strong>Well's procedure</strong> involves suturing of a prosthetic mesh to the posterior part of the lower rectum and the sacral promontory.</li>\n<li><strong>Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy</strong> / <strong>D'Hoore's procedure</strong> involves suturing of a prosthetic mesh to the distal-most part of the anterior wall of the rectum and sacral promontory.

Coal worker's pneumoconiosis is usually benign, and less than 10% of cases develop <strong>progressive massive fibrosis</strong>,\u00a0which may lead to pulmonary dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale.</p>\n<p>Coal workers may also develop <strong>emphysema</strong> or<strong> chronic bronchitis</strong>, independent of smoking. Unlike asbestosis, this condition does not predispose to cancer.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Panacinar emphysema</strong> is caused by <strong>alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency</strong>. It affects the entire acinus and primarily involves the lower lobes. It is not related to occupational exposures like mining but rather a genetic enzyme deficiency that leads to lung damage, making it an unlikely cause in this patient.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Paraseptal emphysema</strong> involves <strong>distal acinar </strong>destruction, often affecting subpleural areas. It is associated with <strong>spontaneous pneumothorax</strong> in young adults. Since this condition is not linked to prolonged dust exposure or mining, it is not the correct answer for this case.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Irregular emphysema</strong> occurs secondary to <strong>lung scarring</strong>, often due to previous infections or fibrosis rather than occupational lung diseases.\u00a0</p>",
