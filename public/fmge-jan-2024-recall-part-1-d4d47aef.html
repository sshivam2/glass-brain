Clinical features are Delirium, slurred speech, choreoathetosis, myoclonus, visual and auditory hallucinations, convulsions and coma, photophobia, blurred vision, dilated pupils poorly reactive to light, arrhythmia, tachycardia, and hypertension. Agitation and delirium are the most serious problems in such patients. The pupils are often dilated and poorly reactive to light.</p>",

This results in the loss of sodium, chloride, and water contributing to the diuretic effect. The diuretic effect of thiazide leads to decreased osmotic pressure due to the loss of Na+, Cl-, and water leading to compensatory reabsorption of uric acid thus resulting in hyperuricemia. The intracytoplasmic Na+ concentration also decreases due to the blockade of the co-transporter. To compensate, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger pumps sodium from the systemic circulation into the epithelial cells in exchange for calcium. The declining calcium levels inside the cell will draw more calcium from the lumen into the systemic circulation. This results in hypercalcemia. There is also increased loss of Mg2+, K+, and H+.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanisms of antihypertensive action:</strong> Decreases plasma and ECF volume by diuresis thereby decreasing cardiac output. Even when the compensatory mechanisms restore the Na+ levels and plasma volume, a low BP is maintained by a reduction in total peripheral resistance. This reduction in total peripheral resistance is due to the persistence of a small sodium and volume deficit even after compensation.

This results in the loss of sodium, chloride, and water contributing to the diuretic effect. The diuretic effect of thiazide leads to decreased osmotic pressure due to the loss of Na+, Cl-, and water leading to compensatory reabsorption of uric acid thus resulting in hyperuricemia. The intracytoplasmic Na+ concentration also decreases due to the blockade of the co-transporter. To compensate, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger pumps sodium from the systemic circulation into the epithelial cells in exchange for calcium. The declining calcium levels inside the cell will draw more calcium from the lumen into the systemic circulation. This results in hypercalcemia. There is also increased loss of Mg2+, K+, and H+.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanisms of antihypertensive action:</strong> Decreases plasma and ECF volume by diuresis thereby decreasing cardiac output. Even when the compensatory mechanisms restore the Na+ levels and plasma volume, a low BP is maintained by a reduction in total peripheral resistance.

The decreased intracellular sodium is responsible for increased compliance of the vessel wall and a reduced response to constrictor stimulus.</p>\n<p>Thiazides are the diuretic of choice for uncomplicated hypertension.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages of thiazide as an antihypertensive are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can be given as once a day dose and has a flat dose-response curve</li>\n<li>Decreased incidence of postural hypotension and relative freedom from CNS side effects</li>\n<li>No tolerance</li>\n<li>No fluid retention</li>\n<li>Decreased risk of osteoporotic fractures due to its hypocalciuric action</li>\n<li>Low cost</li>\n<li>Effectiveness in isolated systolic hypertension</li>\n<li>Thiazides are ineffective both as antihypertensive and diuretic in patients with chronic renal failure.</li>\n</ul>",
