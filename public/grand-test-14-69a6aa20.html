This screw helps in quick healing by <strong>providing compression</strong> at the fracture site and early return to normal activities. The advantage of cannulated screws is that we <strong>can use </strong>a<strong> guidewire </strong>under videofluoroscopy to assist in the <strong>accurate placement</strong> of the screw during surgery.</p>\n<p>Scaphoid fractures occur most commonly after a <strong>fall</strong> on an <strong>outstretched hand.</strong> The <strong>waist</strong> of the scaphoid is the <strong>most common site</strong> of fracture. Initial x-rays are done in anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views. Even if the x-rays appear normal, if there is clinical suspicion, a glass holding cast should be applied for 2 weeks followed by repeat imaging.</p>\n<p>Management depends upon the type of fracture. If the scaphoid <strong>tubercle</strong> is fractured, the patient is given a <strong>glass-holding cast</strong> for <strong>4-6 weeks</strong>. In case of <strong>undisplaced waist fractures</strong>, most people will recover with a <strong>cast</strong> in place for <strong>6-8 weeks</strong>. Percutaneous screw fixation with the <strong>Herbert screw</strong> can be offered to those with <strong>displaced or undisplaced</strong> fractures of the waist when the patient does not want to undergo prolonged cast immobilization, or if they wish to return to work/daily activities sooner. Reducing and fixing displaced fractures also <strong>reduces</strong> the <strong>risk </strong>of <strong>non-union</strong>.</p>\n<p>The most common complications include <strong>nonunion,</strong>\u00a0<strong>avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) </strong>of the <strong>proximal </strong>fracture <strong>segment,\u00a0</strong>and <strong>osteoarthritis.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Herbert screw is shown below:</p>",

An increase in these parameters will increase the oxygen requirement of the heart.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Important determinants of cardiac output are:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Stroke volume</strong>- It is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat. This stroke volume increases whenever, there is <strong>increased venous</strong> return to the heart, increased end-diastolic volume (<strong>preload</strong>), and increased contractility. Contractility further depends on the <strong>initial length</strong> of the cardiac muscle fiber and the <strong>autonomic innervation.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Heart rate</strong>- Increased heart rate increases the cardiac output which in turn increases the oxygen requirement. Heart rate&nbsp;is controlled primarily by the autonomic nerves, with sympathetic stimulation increasing the rate and parasympathetic stimulation decreasing the rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afterload-</strong> The tension at which the load is lifted is called afterload. As the afterload increases, the heart has to work more in order to pump blood to the organs. This in turn results in increased oxygen requirement. It is dependent on the <strong>peripheral resistance.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Drugs used in the management of angina either decrease the work done by the heart or increases the blood flow to the heart.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Nitrates</strong>- They increase the cGMP and cause venodilation. It mainly results in an increase in venous capacitance and a decrease in the ventricular preload. They might also increase coronary flow in some areas and in variant anginas.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong>- Blocking the calcium channels leads to the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles and decreased impulses in the conduction system. This leads to decreased peripheral resistance,&nbsp;decreased blood pressure, decreased contractility, decreased heart rate, and decreased oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Beta-blockers</strong>- They decrease the oxygen requirement by decreasing the&nbsp;heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility. Some drugs like carvedilol and nebivolol also cause vasodilation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Newer antianginal drugs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Ranolazine-&nbsp;</strong>It inhibits the late sodium current and reduces the intracellular calcium concentration. It reduces diastolic tension, cardiac contractility, and work.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Trimetazidine</strong>- inhibits the fatty acid oxidation in the myocardium. It decreases the oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Ivabradine-&nbsp;</strong>decreases the heart rate and decreases oxygen requirement.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Fasudil-&nbsp;</strong>It is a Rho kinase inhibitor. It is useful in coronary vasospasm.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Counterconditioning involves a <strong>gradual approach</strong> to a <strong>feared situation</strong>, in a psychophysiological state that inhibits anxiety, to overcome the maladaptive anxiety elicited by that situation. It works best in cases of a clearly identifiable anxiety-provoking stimulus. It has been successfully used in the treatment of phobias, obsessions, compulsions, and certain sexual disorders.</p>\n<p>It consists of three steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relaxation training</strong> - Patients attain a state of complete relaxation and are then exposed to the stimulus that elicits the anxiety response. Relaxation methods like <strong>yoga</strong>, <strong>progressive relaxation</strong>, <strong>hypnosis</strong>, and <strong>mental imagery</strong> can be used. The physiological changes during the relaxation process; slow heart rate, increased peripheral blood flow, and neuromuscular stability; are opposite to that of the adrenergic response invoked during anxiety. The relaxed state inhibits the negative reaction of anxiety associated with the phobia and this is known as <strong>reciprocal inhibition</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Hierarchy construction&nbsp;</strong>- The therapist determines all the conditions that elicit anxiety and the patients prepare a <strong>graded list or hierarchy</strong> of 10-12 fear-provoking scenes in the order of increasing anxiety.</li>\n<li><strong>Desensitization of the stimulus&nbsp;</strong>- Patients proceed systematically through the list from the least to the most anxiety-provoking scene while in a deeply relaxed state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Flooding</strong>&nbsp;involves repeated and prolonged exposure to fear cues of high intensity<strong>&nbsp;without</strong>&nbsp;a<strong>&nbsp;hierarchy</strong>. It is based on the premise that anxiety gets reinforced by conditioning when the patient escapes from the anxiety-provoking situation. Patients are encouraged to face the feared situations directly and are prevented from escaping. There is <strong>no gradual build-up</strong> or use of relaxation techniques.</p>\n<p>Phobia refers to&nbsp;<strong>excessive fear</strong>&nbsp;of a specific circumstance, situation, or object. A&nbsp;<strong>specific phobia</strong>&nbsp;is a strong and per&shy;sisting fear of a particular situation or an object.&nbsp;<strong>Exposure</strong>&nbsp;or<strong>&nbsp;anticipation</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>contact</strong>&nbsp;with the situation/object triggers an&nbsp;<strong>anxiety reaction</strong>. This inadvertently leads to&nbsp;<strong>panic attacks</strong> in people who are susceptible. The person goes to great lengths to avoid this situation or object. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5), &nbsp;phobias are classified under&nbsp;<strong>Anxiety disorders</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Behavior therapy</strong> is considered the <strong>most effective</strong> treatment for phobias. Systemic desensitization is the most common behavior therapy used for phobias. Other modes of treatment of phobias include insight-oriented psychotherapy, virtual therapy, hypnosis, and family therapy.</p>",

This heightened sensitivity leads to increased heart rate (tachycardia), myocardial contractility, and stroke volume.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced L-type calcium channel activity</strong>: Thyroid hormones increase the activity of L-type calcium channels in the heart, which regulate the influx of calcium ions into cardiac cells. This increased calcium influx enhances myocardial contractility and relaxation.</p>\n<p><strong>Peripheral vasodilation</strong>: Thyroid hormones relax smooth muscle in the peripheral vasculature, leading to vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance. This vasodilation contributes to the bounding pulse and widened pulse pressure observed in thyrotoxicosis.</p>\n<p>Indirect Actions:<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Increased metabolic rate</strong>: This metabolic increase demands a higher cardiac output to meet the body's oxygen requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased blood volume</strong>: Thyroid hormones promote fluid retention, resulting in an increase in blood volume.

Therefore, the baby has to put more effort to expand the lungs. This results in respiratory distress and hypoxemia.&nbsp;Ischemic damage to the alveoli causes the transudation of proteins into the alveoli that form the <strong>hyaline membrane<span class=\"s1\">.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It usually occurs in the first few hours of life.
