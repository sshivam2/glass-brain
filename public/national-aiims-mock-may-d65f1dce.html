    "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario with <strong>&uarr;serum osmolality</strong> and <strong>&darr;urinary osmolality</strong>, after a cranial surgery, suggests a diagnosis of <strong>post-surgical central&nbsp;diabetes insipidus (DI).&nbsp;</strong>Irreversible central DI follows most cases of complete resections of craniopharyngioma.</p>\n<p>Serum osmolality<strong>&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>&gt;295 mOsm/L</strong>&nbsp;(normal: 280-295 mOsm/L) and the urine osmolality of&nbsp;<strong>&lt;300 mOsm/L </strong>(normal: 500-850mOsm/L)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are suggestive of DI. A water deprivation test is done to further classify the types of DI. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;In postoperative patients, because of IV fluids there is an acute expansion of ECF volume. This suppresses high ADH activity and causes diuresis with <strong>normal</strong> serum osmolality.</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;In SIADH, serum osmolality is <strong>decreased</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: In cerebral salt-wasting syndrome there is&nbsp;hypersecretion ANP and their levels are&nbsp;usually&nbsp;<strong>elevated</strong>.</p>",
