But the <strong>overall most common</strong> cause of rickets remains to be <strong>nutritional vitamin D deficiency</strong>. PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating endopeptidase on <strong>X chromosome</strong>) products are responsible for the <strong>inactivation of phosphatonin</strong>. Mutation of this PHEX leads to <strong>increased phosphatonin (FGF 23) levels</strong>. This leads to <strong>impaired </strong>renal tubular <strong>reabsorption</strong> of <strong>phosphate</strong> and hence the excretion of phosphorous is increased. It also inhibits <strong>renal 1-alpha hydroxylase</strong> leading to<strong> reduced 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The patient's laboratory reports will show<strong> low phosphate levels</strong> or <strong>increased urinary phosphate</strong>. All other parameters such as <strong>calcium</strong>, <strong>PTH(parathyroid hormone)</strong> and <strong>pH</strong> are <strong>normal</strong> with <strong>raised alkaline phosphatase(ALP)</strong> levels.</p>\n<p>Clinical features of X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic(XLH) rickets include lower extremity abnormalities, <strong>short stature</strong>, poor growth, <strong>delayed dentition</strong>, and tooth abscesses. The wind-swept deformity is due to <strong>genu</strong> varus(leg going inward compared to the knee joint) on one side and <strong>genu valgus</strong>(leg going outward compared to the knee)\u00a0on the contralateral side.</p>\n<p>Mainstay treatment of hypophosphatemic rickets includes <strong>oral phosphorus</strong> and<strong> 1,25-D (calcitriol)</strong>. Phosphorus supplementation is usually given in <strong>1-3 g</strong> elemental phosphorus divided into 4\u20135 doses. Frequent dosing reduces <strong>diarrhoea</strong>, which is a complication of high-dose oral phosphorus. <strong>Calcitriol</strong> is administered <strong>30\u201370 ng/kg/day</strong> divided into 2 doses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

Therefore, concurrent statin therapy substantially increases the effectiveness of bile acid sequestrants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another effect of <strong>increased hepatic bile acid synthesis</strong> is that it also causes an <strong>increase in hepatic triglyceride synthesis</strong>, which is of consequence in patients with <strong>significant hypertriglyceridemia</strong>.

At the normal PCO<sub>2</sub> of 45 mm Hg in the tissues (represented by point A), 52% volume of CO<sub>2</sub> combines with the blood. Upon entering the lungs, the PCO<sub>2</sub> falls to 40 mm Hg and the PO<sub>2</sub> rises to 100 mm Hg.
