Symptoms include abdominal pain, persistent diarrhoea, weight loss, and fatigue. Patients may also experience extraintestinal manifestations such as arthritis, <strong>erythema nodosum,</strong> uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The disease follows a relapsing-remitting course, with periods of flare-ups and remission.</p>\n<p>The exact cause of Crohn\u2019s disease remains unclear, but it is believed to result from a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, immune system dysregulation, and environmental triggers such as diet, smoking, and gut microbiota imbalance. Diagnosis is made through a combination of clinical presentation, endoscopy with biopsy, imaging studies, and laboratory markers like <strong>faecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein</strong>. Treatment aims to control inflammation, relieve symptoms, and prevent complications. This includes medications such as <strong>aminosalicylates, corticosteroids</strong>, immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies targeting tumour necrosis factor-alpha (<strong>TNF-\u03b1) or integrins</strong>. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be required, but recurrence after surgery is common. Long-term management involves dietary modifications, smoking cessation, and regular monitoring to reduce disease progression and complications.\u00a0</p>",
