Tyrosine gives rise to catecholamines like dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Thus, low levels of tyrosine may lead to a <strong>deficiency</strong> of <strong>dopamine, norepinephrine,</strong> and<strong> epinephrine</strong>. However, this is not the reason for the mousy odor of urine.</p>\n<p>PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme <strong>phenylalanine hydroxylase</strong> (classic PKU) or defects in the enzymes involved in producing tetrahydrobiopterin. These deficiencies impair the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, leading to <strong>elevated</strong> levels of <strong>phenylalanine</strong> and <strong>low</strong> levels of <strong>tyrosine</strong> in the body. The&nbsp;excess phenylalanine in the blood is metabolized to phenyl ketones (<strong>phenylpyruvate</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>phenylacetate</strong>)&nbsp;which are <strong>excreted in the urine</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Affected infants initially appear normal at birth. If left untreated, they gradually develop profound <strong>intellectual disability</strong>. Older untreated children may exhibit <strong>hyperactivity</strong>, <strong>autistic behaviors</strong>, and neurologic signs such as <strong>seizures</strong>, spasticity, and tremors. Abnormalities like <strong>microcephaly</strong>, prominent maxillae, and growth retardation are seen. They are also prone to low bone mineral density and <strong>osteopenia</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Untreated PKU patients may exhibit <strong>hypopigmentation</strong> (fair hair, light skin color, and blue eyes) due to <strong>low</strong> levels of <strong>tyrosine</strong>, which is necessary for the formation of melanin pigment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a woman with PKU is not following a low-phenylalanine diet during pregnancy, it can lead to <strong>maternal PKU syndrome</strong> in the offspring. This condition is associated with <strong>microcephaly</strong> and <strong>congenital heart disease</strong>.</p>\n<p>The preferred screening method is <strong>tandem mass spectrometry</strong>.&nbsp;If screening is positive, the diagnosis is confirmed by quantitatively measuring phenylalanine levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The primary treatment for PKU is a <strong>low-phenylalanine diet</strong>, which should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is established.&nbsp;<strong>Lifelong</strong> <strong>restriction</strong> of dietary phenylalanine is recommended. <strong>Tyrosine</strong> becomes an <strong>essential amino acid</strong> in PKU and it needs to be obtained from the diet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The series of reactions involving the production of catecholamines is shown in the image below:</p>",

The concept of <strong>molecular mimicry</strong> is used to explain the pathogenesis of the condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since one attack of ARF increases the risk for further episodes and development of RHD, <strong>secondary prophylaxis</strong> is recommended by the American heart association (AHA) as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rheumatic fever <strong>without carditis</strong>: For<strong> 5 years</strong> after the last attack or <strong>till 21</strong> years of age (whichever is longer).&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Rheumatic fever <strong>with carditis</strong> but <strong>no</strong> residual<strong> valvular disease</strong>: For <strong>10 years</strong> after the last attack or <strong>till 21</strong>&nbsp;years of age (whichever is longer).</li>\n<li>Rheumatic fever with <strong>persistent valvular disease</strong>, evident clinically or on echocardiography: For <strong>10 years</strong> after the last attack or <strong>till</strong> the age of <strong>40</strong> (whichever is longer). Sometimes <strong>lifelong</strong> prophylaxis can be given.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Symptoms usually present after a latent period of about three weeks. Indolent carditis and chorea are the exceptions that can present even six months later. <strong>Migratory asymmetric polyarthritis</strong>&nbsp;which affects large joints and <strong>high-grade fever</strong> are common features. Cutaneous manifestations include <strong>erythema marginatum</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>subcutaneous nodules</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;Sydenham's chorea</strong> is commonly found in <strong>females</strong> and frequently affects the head and upper limbs. Acute rheumatic carditis can be seen as the involvement of the endocardium, myocardium, or pericardium. Histopathological examination shows <strong>Aschoff bodies</strong>&nbsp;and activated macrophages called <strong>Anitschkow cells</strong>.</p>\n<p>The image below shows Aschoff bodies:</p>",

This can be contributed to maternal depression being a <strong>confounder</strong>.</p>\n<p>When used in the second half of pregnancy, SSRIs have been associated with an increased risk of precipitating&nbsp;<strong>persistent pulmonary hypertension</strong>&nbsp;in the newborn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There has been evidence of a <strong>transient delay</strong> in <strong>developmental milestones</strong> in patients who were exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy. Most studies have observed that the development returns to normal after some time. But if the mother is severely depressed, delayed developmental milestones have also been attributed to the mother's disinterest in the infant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other side effects of SSRIs include:</p>\n<table style=\"width: 329px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 119px;\"><strong>System</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\"><strong>Side effects of SSRIs</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 119px;\">Sexual</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\"><strong>Anorgasmia</strong>, Decreased libido</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 119px;\">Gastrointestinal ( 5-HT3 receptor)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\"><strong>Nausea</strong>, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, flatulence, and dyspepsia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 119px;\">Nervous system</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\">Extremely&nbsp;<strong>vivid dreams</strong>&nbsp;or nightmares, Anxiety, Insomnia/sedation, seizures, emotional blunting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 119px;\">Anticholinergic</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\"><strong>Dry mouth</strong>, constipation, sedation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 119px;\">Cardiovascular</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\">Drug-induced long QT syndrome</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 119px;\">Hematological</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\">Easy bruising</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 119px;\">Endocrine</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\">Mammoplasia, galactorrhea</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

Urine alkalinization is recommended as a first-line treatment only for moderately severe salicylate poisoning that&nbsp;does not meet the criteria for hemodialysis.</p>\n<p>Alkalinization of the urine is achieved by administration of&nbsp;<strong>100&ndash;150 mEq</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>sodium bicarbonate</strong>&nbsp;in 1 L of 5% dextrose in water (D5W). It is infused intravenously&nbsp;at twice the maintenance fluid requirements.</p>\n<p>Alkalinization of urine is&nbsp;<strong>contraindicated</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>renal failure</strong>&nbsp;or if fluid administration may worsen&nbsp;<strong>pulmonary edema</strong>&nbsp;or congestive heart failure.</p>",

    "solution": "<p>Delayed hypersensitivity is due to <strong>interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).</strong></p>\n<p>Delayed hypersensitivity is also called cell-mediated/type 4 hypersensitivity reaction. It is mediated by T cells and occurs by 2 mechanisms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CD4+ T helper cells mediated</li>\n<li>CD8+ T helper cells mediated</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>CD4+ T helper cells</strong> mediated pathway:</p>\n<p>Antigen peptides recognized by CD4+ T cells secrete <strong>interluekin -2</strong>. Interleukin -2 helps in further proliferation of T cells that respond to the antigen peptide. These T cells differentiate into <strong>Th1</strong> or <strong>Th17</strong> cells as a result of the cytokines produced from the antigen presenting cells (APC).</p>\n<p>APCs also secrete <strong>interleukin - 12</strong> which enhances differentiation of the T cells to the Th1 subset. Inflammatory cytokines like interluekins -1, 6, 23 induce differentiation of T cells to the Th17 subset. These responses lead to the release of <strong>interferon gamma</strong> that alters the macrophages in several ways to ensure eliminating the antigen.</p>\n<p><strong>Interferon-gamma-induced changes</strong> in the macrophages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Augmented ability</strong> of the macrophages to <strong>phagocytose</strong> and kill micro-organisms.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased</strong> expression of<strong> class 2 MHC molecules</strong> to enhance antigen presentation.</li>\n<li>Increased secretion in presence of&nbsp;<strong>tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1,</strong> and other inflammatory chemokines.</li>\n<li><strong>Amplification</strong> of the Th1 response by producing more <strong>interleukin-12.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>CD8+ T helper cells</strong> mediated pathway:</p>\n<p>CD8+ T cells destroy antigen-presenting target cells using <strong>perforins</strong> and <strong>granzymes</strong>. These mediators are preformed in the lysosomes of a cell. The perforin-granzyme complex enters the target cell by endocytosis. Granzymes cause the activation of caspases inducing apoptosis of the target cell. <strong>CD8+ T cells</strong> also produce <strong>interferon gamma</strong>&nbsp;following viral infections and contact allergens. Interferon-gamma then proceeds to stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators and bring about the hypersensitivity reaction.</p>\n<p>Examples of delayed hypersensitivity reactions include the <strong>tuberculin reaction</strong> and <strong>contact dermatitis.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Interferon-gamma </strong>is an important <strong>effector</strong> involved in <strong>both immune mechanisms</strong> of delayed hypersensitivity reactions and hence is the best answer for this question.</p>",
