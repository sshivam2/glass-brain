A level of <strong>more</strong> than <strong>1000pg/ml</strong> is <strong>diagnostic.</strong> (Normal - 100pg/ml) Management involves the correction of <strong>nutritional deficiencies</strong> with enteral nutrition. <strong>Octreotide</strong> can help reverse the catabolic state. <strong>DVT prophylaxis</strong> should be provided as soon as possible. <strong>Surgery</strong> can be done if the mass is resectable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Gastrinomas</strong> are islet cell tumors that produce large amounts of gastrin. This <strong>gastrin</strong> does not respond to the normal feedback mechanism and is <strong>not suppressed</strong> by high luminal pH. Patients with gastrinomas present with abdominal pain and diarrhea.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Insulinomas</strong> are the <strong>most common</strong> pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. They are characterized by symptoms of hypoglycemia, low plasma glucose at the time of symptoms, and relief of symptoms on glucose consumption. This is known as the <strong>Whipple's</strong> triad.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>VIPoma</strong> is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the pancreatic D2 islet cells.

    "solution": "<p><strong>Necroptosis</strong> is a <strong>caspase-independent</strong>&nbsp;pathway.</p>\n<p><strong>Necroptosis</strong>, as the name suggests has features similar to necrosis and apoptosis. Like necrosis, it is characterized by loss of ATP, cellular and organelle swelling, the release of lysosomal enzymes, and rupture of the plasma membrane. However, like apoptosis, this is programmed cell death. This is a <strong>caspase-independent</strong> programmed cell death. It is also called <strong>programmed necrosis.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>TNF-&alpha; activates TNFR1 and, in turn, induces the recruitment of RIP1 and RIP3 kinase and other proteins to form a complex.</li>\n<li>This complex includes caspase 8. But,&nbsp;<strong>caspase 8</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>not activated</strong> in this pathway.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">RIPK3 phosphorylates a cytoplasmic protein called MLKL.

Inflammasome activates <strong>caspase 1</strong> and helps in the release of the biologically activated forms of <strong>IL-1</strong>.&nbsp;Along with caspase 1, caspases 4 and 5 also induce cell death. Unlike classical apoptosis, pyroptosis is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Options A and B: The <strong>intrinsic</strong> mitochondrial and <strong>extrinsic</strong> death receptor-initiated <strong>pathways</strong> converge to <strong>activate</strong> a <strong>caspase</strong> cascade that <strong>mediates</strong> the final phase of <strong>apoptosis.</strong> The <strong>intrinsic pathway </strong>activates<strong> caspase 9</strong> whereas the <strong>extrinsic pathway</strong> activates <strong>caspases 8 </strong>and<strong> 10</strong>. These caspases then activate<strong>&nbsp;caspase 3, </strong>and<strong> caspase 6</strong>.&nbsp;Activated caspases cause DNA degradation and nuclei fragmentation.</p>",
