Re-evaluation should be done after birth and in cases presenting with <strong>symptoms of recurrent UTI, palpable flank mass or pain, urinary obstruction, and in cases of failure to thrive</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the hydronephrosis is persistent, its <strong>severity</strong> is <strong>graded</strong> by the extent of the dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system and parenchymal thickness. It needs to be ascertained whether the other kidney is involved, the lower ureter is dilated, the bladder wall is thickened, and whether emptying of the bladder is incomplete. Based on these findings, a diagnosis can be made.</p>\n<p>In cases of hydronephrosis, <strong>long-standing urine stasis</strong> and pressure may <strong>damage the kidney</strong>s.</p>\n<p>The causes of UPJ obstruction are</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Intrinsic (due to an adynamic or stenotic segment of the proximal ureter) or&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Extrinsic (e.g. compression by accessory renal arteries). This needs to be corrected primarily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The renal anatomy and function can be assessed using <strong>radioscintigraphy</strong> studies. The&nbsp;<strong>investigation of choice</strong>&nbsp;for UPJ obstruction is<strong>&nbsp;</strong><sup>99m</sup>Tc-MercaptoAcetyl-triGlycine<strong>&nbsp;(MAG3) scan.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Micturating cystourethrogram</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;investigation of choice in&nbsp;<strong>vesicoureteric reflux.</strong> <sup>99m</sup>Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid&nbsp;<strong>(DMSA) scan</strong>&nbsp;is used for assessing&nbsp;<strong>renal scarring</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> of intrinsic UPJ obstruction is done <strong>surgically if renal function is compromised</strong> or if there is bilateral involvement of the kidneys. In other cases, <strong>serial follow-up with ultrasonography</strong> is done to assess the spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Vesicoureteral reflux</strong> is the <strong>second most common</strong> cause of hydronephrosis after UPJ obstruction.&nbsp;In vesicoureteric reflux, the&nbsp;valve that prevents the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter is defective;&nbsp;hence, abnormal <strong>backflow of urine</strong> occurs <strong>from</strong> the&nbsp;<strong>bladder</strong> into the <strong>ureter</strong>. It may also present with hydronephrosis; however, the distal ureter is also involved, unlike in this case.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Ureterocele</strong> is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, thought to result from the persistence of the membrane between the ureteral bud and urogenital sinus. Since the distal urinary tract is normal-looking in this case, this diagnosis is unlikely.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Posterior urethral valve</strong> is an <strong>obstructing membrane</strong> in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in-utero&nbsp;development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. As a result, bilateral hydronephrosis and bladder dilatation is seen, unlike the unilateral involvement in this case.</p>",

The symptoms include <strong>mucopurulent discharge, pain on defecation, constipation, and tenesmus.</strong>&nbsp;The disruption of anorectal epithelial integrity, together with the local recruitment of HIV-target cell types (dendritic cells and CCR5/CD4+ T cells) predisposes the patient to a higher risk of developing <strong>HIV</strong> infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Gonorrhea</strong> is a sexually transmitted disease caused by&nbsp;<strong>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</strong>. It uses pilli in adhesion to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces. The cocci penetrate the intracellular spaces to reach the subepithelial tissue by the third day of infection. The incubation period is 2-8 days.</p>\n<p>The major symptoms include&nbsp;<strong>urethral discharge</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>dysuria</strong>, usually without urinary frequency or urgency. The specific symptoms seen in males and females are as follows:</p>\n<p>In males :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acute urethritis:</strong> This infection may extend along the urethra to involve the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis.</li>\n<li><strong>Genital discharge:</strong> It is mucopurulent that can be described as that resembling 'flow of seed' (semen).</li>\n<li><strong>Strictures:</strong> <strong>Chronic urethritis</strong>&nbsp;may lead to&nbsp;stricture&nbsp;formation.</li>\n<li><strong>Water-can perineum:</strong> The infection may spread to the periurethral tissues causing abscesses and multiple discharging sinuses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In females:</p>\n<p>About half the female patients remain asymptomatic.&nbsp;The patients typically present with urethritis, cervical&nbsp;discharge, pruritus, dysuria, and intermenstrual bleeding.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>ectocervix</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>vagina</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;not usually affected in&nbsp;<strong>adults</strong>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;<strong>stratified squamous epithelium is resistant</strong>&nbsp;to infection by the cocci.

Unilateral pain and swelling over the labia may be caused by the inflammation of the&nbsp;Bartholin glands.</p>\n<p><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>salpingitis</strong>&nbsp;may lead to&nbsp;<strong>sterility.</strong>&nbsp;Other complications are <strong>tubo-ovarian abscesses</strong> and <strong>ectopic pregnancies</strong>.

Cultures can be obtained from&nbsp;<strong>chocolate agar</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Mueller-Hinton agar</strong>.&nbsp;Specifically,&nbsp;<strong>Thayer-Martin agar</strong>&nbsp;is used to isolate&nbsp;<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae.</em></p>\n<p>Treatment</p>\n<p>According to&nbsp;<strong>CDC guidelines (2021)</strong>, treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weight &lt;150 kg &ndash; Ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscular (IM) in a single dose</li>\n<li>Weight &ge;150 kg &ndash; Ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscular (IM) in a single dose</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The doses of ceftriaxone are higher than the previous guidelines as the gonococcal&nbsp;<strong>minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are rising worldwide</strong>. BASHH (British Association for Sexual Health and HIV) in the United Kingdom also recommends higher doses of ceftriaxone&nbsp;of about 500 mg or 1g along with&nbsp;<strong>azithromycin</strong>&nbsp;because it would result in fewer failures.</p>\n<p>Concurrent&nbsp;<strong>chlamydial</strong>&nbsp;infection must also be treated unless it has been excluded by&nbsp;<strong>molecular testing</strong>. First-line drugs used are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oral&nbsp;<strong>azithromycin</strong>&nbsp;<strong>1g</strong>&nbsp;single dose</li>\n<li>Oral&nbsp;<strong>doxycycline</strong>&nbsp;<strong>100 mg BD</strong>&nbsp;for 7 days (non-pregnant patients only)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The third-generation cephalosporins are contraindicated in patients with a history of&nbsp;IgE-mediated penicillin allergy.
