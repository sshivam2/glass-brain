The neonatal line is formed soon after birth and can be seen in about 3 weeks or by electron microscopy 1&ndash;2 days after birth. This method is applicable mainly to estimate the age of dead infants.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option B- <strong>Stack&rsquo;s method</strong>:&nbsp;Determination of age is done from the weight of the erupting teeth of the fetus/ infant. It can be used on both deciduous and permanent teeth in their erupting phase.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C-<strong> Miles' method:</strong>&nbsp;Age estimation is made on the basis of a comparison of the amount of wear on all three permanent molars with the baseline. It is used to determine the age beyond 25 years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D- <strong>Gustafson&rsquo;s Method:&nbsp;</strong>It&nbsp;is based on&nbsp;physiological changes in teeth. It is used to determine the age between 25-60 years. Gustafson&rsquo;s criteria include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attrition:</strong>&nbsp;Wear and tear changes of the occlusal surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Periodontosis:</strong>&nbsp;Regression of gums surrounding the tooth resulting in loosening of the tooth and falling.</li>\n<li><strong>Secondary dentin:</strong>&nbsp;Deposition of dentin in the pulp cavity.</li>\n<li><strong>Cementum apposition:</strong>&nbsp;Deposition of cementum in the root forming incremental lines.</li>\n<li><strong>Root resorption:</strong>&nbsp;Involves both cementum and dentin.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency of the root</strong>: This is<strong>&nbsp;the most reliable&nbsp;</strong>criterion.
