Facial weakness may cause a characteristic <strong>snarling expression</strong> when smiling, and patients often experience difficulty in chewing, nasal speech due to palate and tongue weakness, and swallowing difficulties.

The amount of bleeding during surgery can be higher in cases of molar pregnancy compared to a uterus of similar size that contains nonmolar products. Having large moles necessitates the use of appropriate anesthetic, sufficient intravenous access, and availability of blood-banking services. To perform a molar evacuation, the<strong> cervix is mechanically dilated</strong> to facilitate the insertion of a large <strong>Karman</strong> <strong>suction</strong> <strong>cannula</strong>. A normal diameter of <strong>10 to 14 mm</strong> is common, depending on the size of the uterus. <strong>Oxytocin</strong> is used during the <strong>evacuation</strong> process to <strong>minimize</strong> <strong>hemorrhage</strong>. <strong>Intraoperative</strong> <strong>sonography</strong> is frequently advised to guarantee thorough evacuation of the uterine cavity and <strong>reduce</strong> the <strong>risk</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>perforation</strong>. When the <strong>myometrium</strong> has <strong>contracted,</strong> a meticulous yet delicate <strong>curettage</strong> can be performed with a sharp large-loop <strong>Sims</strong> <strong>curette</strong>.

This is typically done with a combination of <strong>hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, and oxytocin. </strong>Sheehan syndrome is due to <strong>pituitary infarction</strong> consequent to <strong>traumatic major</strong> blood loss after <strong>child</strong> birth.</p>\n<p>The pituitary undergoes <strong>hyperplastic enlargement</strong> during pregnancy, which increases the risk of haemorrhage and infarction.</p>\n<p>The most prominent symptoms are the inability to nurse <strong>(lactational failure) </strong>due to absent prolactin secretion and postpartum amenorrhea due to absent FSH and LH secretion.</p>\n<p>Patients affected may have <strong>persistent hypotension, tachycardia, </strong>and <strong>hypoglycemia</strong> due to secondary adrenal insufficiency. <strong>Cortisol levels</strong> are affected leading to <strong>hypovolemia, hypoglycemia,</strong> and <strong>hyponatremia.</strong> Aldosterone is unaffected, and there is no salt wasting. <strong>Adrenal insufficiency</strong> is the most life-threatening complication. Hence, the first hormone to be replaced is <strong>glucocorticoids.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other options:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Pegvisomant</strong> is a growth hormone receptor antagonist. It is indicated for the treatment of <strong>acromegaly.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Bromocriptine</strong> is a dopamine receptor analogue used for the management of lactorrhea seen in a functional prolactinoma.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Pituitary resection</strong> is appropriate for <strong>craniopharyngiomas,</strong> benign tumours derived from <strong>Rathke\u2019s pouch,</strong> a diverticulum arising from the embryonic buccal cavity, from which the anterior pituitary gland develops. It is most commonly seen in children (5\u201315 years); however, it exhibits a bimodal incidence and can also be seen in adults (55\u201365 years). Patients present with features of <strong>raised intracranial pressure</strong>, visual impairment in the form of <strong>bitemporal hemianopia</strong> and <strong>endocrinologic abnormalities,</strong> such as growth failure, hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, and delayed sexual maturation due to pituitary hypo-function. MRI shows <strong>calcified cystic masses</strong> in the <strong>supra-sellar region.</strong></p>",

This <strong>enhances wound healing</strong> by preventing the formation of unnecessary cavities. Drains are prophylactic in elective surgeries and therapeutic in emergency surgeries. Drains can be -</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open</strong> - They are based on the principle of <strong>gravity\u00a0</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Semi-open</strong> - Their action is based on <strong>capillary effect</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Closed</strong> - They carry out their actions through <strong>suction</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Suction drains are commonly used in chest, <strong>breast</strong>, abdominal, thyroid, and plastic surgeries. They remove intraperitoneal secretions, anastomotic leaks, and blood from hemorrhage at the surgical site.\u00a0Romo Vac drain<strong>\u00a0</strong>is a <strong>negative suction drain </strong>closed drain kept in the subcutaneous tissue. Romo Vac drain is indicated in modified radical mastectomy, subcutaneous swelling excision, and amputations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special types of drains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chest drains</strong> (option A) are connected to an underwater seal to aid the exit of air from the pleural cavity. They are used in pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and hemothorax.\u00a0</li>\n<li>After surgical exploration of the bile duct, the sphincter of Oddi goes into spasm. To facilitate drainage of bile, a <strong>T tube</strong> may be used.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drain insertion site care</strong>:\u00a0The site of insertion of the drain is kept clean by drying and patting the drain insertion site with a clean towel after bath. The dressing is changed daily with folded gauze pieces placed below and above the drain site.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Removal of drains</strong>: The catheter at the site is milked for residual collections. It is then clamped and the suture holding the catheter is cut. The tube is then gently pulled out and any clots at the perforation end are removed. The time of removal of drains for various conditions is given below.\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drains used in surgeries like <strong>thyroidectomy</strong> are usually removed within <strong>24 hours</strong>. Their main purpose is to cover postoperative bleeding.\u00a0</li>\n<li>In a <strong>mastectomy</strong>, a drain is placed for <strong>5 days</strong> to collect serous collections.</li>\n<li>Drains used to cover the <strong>colorectal anastomoses</strong> are placed for <strong>5-7 days.</strong></li>\n<li>Common bile duct<strong> T-tube drains</strong> are usually placed for<strong> 10 days.</strong></li>\n<li>Drains for infections are removed when the infection subsides or when the content of the drain is minimal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the drain is removed, a folded gauze is placed over the drain insertion area.\u00a0The dressing can be removed after 24 hours. The patient may be given an antibiotic ointment to apply over the area for a week.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The following image shows an <strong>underwater seal drain</strong>.</p>",
