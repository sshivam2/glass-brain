Pelvic fracture is most commonly caused by road traffic accident. Clinical features include urinary retention, blood at the urethral meatus and on <strong>digital rectal examination,</strong> there will be a\u00a0<strong>high riding prostate </strong>called as <strong>vermooten sign . </strong>Marked bruising of the penis, scrotum and pubic area is commonly associated.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Urethrogram with water-soluble contrast is used for confirmation of the diagnosis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Management is by inserting a\u00a0<strong>suprapubic catheter</strong>. If there is an associated\u00a0<strong>bladder rupture</strong>, the bladder will not be seen on the ultrasound, and management in such a case is by\u00a0<strong>exploration,</strong>\u00a0<strong>repair</strong>, and placement of a\u00a0<strong>suprapubic catheter.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option A: <strong>Bulbar urethral injury</strong> is the <strong>most common type</strong> of urethral injury.

Clinical features are same as bulbar urethral injury.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D: <strong>Urinary bladder rupture</strong> can be intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal. <strong>Extraperitoneal</strong> bladder rupture is the<strong> most common</strong>. <strong>Intraperitoneal</strong> bladder rupture is caused by a blow or a fall on the <strong>distended bladder</strong>. Intraperitoneal bladder rupture manifests as sudden severe pain in the hypogastrium and syncope. Extraperitoneal bladder rupture is caused by blunt trauma or surgical damage.</p>",

The most common are <strong>Broca, Wernicke, conduction</strong>, and <strong>global</strong> aphasias.

Women with collagen disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are more susceptible to this condition.</p>\n<p>The mother presents with <strong>shock immediately</strong> after delivery, the degree of the&nbsp;<strong>shock is out of proportion</strong> to the amount of bleeding. It&nbsp;is both neurogenic and hemorrhagic.&nbsp;During the abdominal examination, <strong>a cup</strong> or <strong>dimpled appearance</strong> is observed on the surface of the <strong>fundu</strong>s. In cases of the complete variety, a pear-shaped mass protrudes from the vulva, with a broad end pointing downward and looking reddish purple in color.</p>\n<p>The ideal treatment is an <strong>immediate replacement</strong> of the uterus. It should be immediately reposited by exerting <strong>firm and constant pressure</strong> on the inverted uterine fundus. If the placenta is attached to the uterus, it must not be removed until after the replacement has been effected. The best method of replacing the uterus has been described by <strong>O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>O&rsquo;Sullivan's method:</strong>&nbsp; Here the patient is anesthetized and a&nbsp;gallon of warm sterile water is used for irrigation into the vagina, using an irrigating can raised 3 to 4 feet&nbsp;above the level of the patient. After gently pushing the inverted uterine fundus back into the vagina, the nozzle of the irrigating cannula is inserted into the vagina, and the vaginal orifice is closed by the hands of the operator and an assistant. Around 3-5L of fluid may be required, and the inversion will be slowly corrected by the hydrostatic pressure. If this method fails, manual repositioning may be attempted under deep anesthesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Reposition of the uterus may be done by abdominal operation after trying manual and hydrostatic methods.</p>",
