However, with time, this stasis leads to splenic infarction, fibrosis, and shrinkage of the spleen. <strong>By adolescence</strong>, only a <strong>small fibrous remnant </strong>may be<strong> left behind</strong> in place of the normal spleen.

The usual presentation is <strong>symmetrical</strong>, <strong>ascending</strong> <strong>paralysis</strong> evolving over hours to a few days. The legs are usually more affected than the arms. Lower cranial nerves are also frequently involved, causing <strong>bulbar weakness</strong> and difficulty in maintaining an airway and handling secretions. Almost one-third of the patients require <strong>mechanical ventilation</strong> due to <strong>weakness of the respiratory muscles</strong>. <strong>Deep tendon reflexes</strong> also attenuate or <strong>disappear</strong> within a few days of onset.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sensations carried by large myelinated fibers like deep tendon reflexes and <strong>proprioception</strong> are also <strong>affected</strong>. Pain and temperature sensations are relatively preserved. Pain in the neck, shoulder, back, buttocks, and thighs is a common complaint in the early phase of the disease. The pain is usually <strong>aching or throbbing</strong> in nature. <strong>Autonomic involvement</strong> is also frequent in patients with GBS and usually presents with loss of vasomotor control with <strong>wide fluctuations in blood pressure</strong> and <strong>postural hypotension</strong>.</p>\n<p>The patient is likely to have <strong>clinical worsening during the first four weeks </strong>following the onset of weakness. After this, there's a plateauing of the symptoms and any further deterioration is unlikely.</p>\n<p>Although fever might be present during the antecedent infection (for example, <em>Campylobacter</em> diarrhea) which acted as a trigger for GBS, <strong>fever and constitutional symptoms</strong> are <strong>absent</strong> <strong>at</strong> the <strong>onset</strong> <strong>of</strong> the <strong>weakness</strong>. Similarly, bladder dysfunction occurs only in severe GBS and is transient. Prominent <strong>bladder dysfunction</strong> occurring <strong>early</strong> in the disease course <strong>goes</strong> <strong>against</strong> the <strong>diagnosis</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>GBS</strong>.&nbsp;</p>",

Switch recombinase is the enzyme that catalyzes the rearrangement of VDJ genes during class switching.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>IL-4</strong> enhances the class switching to <strong>IgE</strong> whereas <strong>IL-5</strong> increases the <strong>IgA</strong>. Moreover, the interaction of the CD40 protein on the B-cell with the CD40 ligand on the helper T-cell also enables class switching. In <strong>hyper-IgM syndrome</strong>, there is a <strong>failure in the interaction of CD40 and CD40 ligand</strong>. This leads to an <strong>overproduction</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>IgM</strong> and a deficiency of IgG, IgA, and IgE.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Somatic hypermutation</strong>\u00a0(option A) is a cellular response by which the immune system modifies the immune response to antigens. It is done by adding nucleotides in V gene regions of heavy and light chains, resulting in a<strong> better fit</strong> <strong>of antigen with the antibodies</strong>. This\u00a0<strong>increases</strong> the <strong>affinity</strong> of antibodies to antigens. Due to this, the subset of plasma cells with improved hypervariable regions is more strongly selected by the antigen and constitutes a larger part of the population of antibody-producing cells. This process is called <strong>affinity maturation </strong>(Option C).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Allelic exclusion</strong>\u00a0(option D) is the process by which a cell <strong>expresses one </strong>of the<strong> two alleles</strong> of the gene and excludes the other allele.\u00a0<strong>B cells </strong>are <strong>diploid</strong>, therefore, each B cell has <strong>six gene segment pools </strong>related to antibody chains:\u00a0<strong>two heavy-chain pools </strong>(one from each parent) and\u00a0<strong>four light-chain pools </strong>(one \u03ba and one \u03bb from each parent). However, <strong>each B cell uses</strong> <strong>only two</strong> of the six <strong>gene segment pools</strong>: one out of the two heavy-chain pools (maternal and paternal) and one out of the four light-chain pools. Thus, each B cell must choose not only between its \u03ba and \u03bb light-chain pools but also between its maternal and paternal light-chain and heavy-chain pools. This process of choosing is by allelic exclusion.</p>",

    "solution": "<p><strong>ADP</strong> would have contributed to the <strong>pro-thrombotic state</strong> in this patient.</p>\n<p>Following a traumatic vascular injury, the circulating platelets come in contact with the subendothelial connective tissue. <strong>Platelet adhesion</strong> is mediated by <strong>GpIb</strong> glycoprotein receptor present on the platelets and the <strong>von Willebrand factor (vWF)</strong> present on the exposed tissue below the vascular endothelium. Following this, the platelets rapidly change shape and <strong>release granule contents</strong>. This is known as <strong>platelet activation</strong>. <strong>ADP</strong>, which is present in <strong>dense granules</strong>, <strong>causes</strong> the <strong>activation of more platelets</strong> by binding to <strong>P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor</strong>. This phenomenon is called recruitment. The next step is <strong>platelet aggregation</strong>. <strong>GpIIb/IIIa</strong> undergoes a conformational change during platelet activation and allows binding to <strong>fibrinogen</strong>, leading to their aggregation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Local activation of the <strong>coagulation cascade</strong> occurs following the formation of the platelet plug. This leads to <strong>fibrin polymerization</strong> and cementing of the platelets into the definitive secondary hemostatic plug. However, there are certain counter-regulatory mechanisms that keep the process of coagulation limited to the site of the injury. This includes <strong>fibrinolysis</strong>, which is mediated by <strong>plasmin</strong>. Fibrin is broken down during this process and its further polymerization is stopped. Plasmin is generated by the catabolism of the <strong>precursor plasminogen</strong> by circulating <strong>plasminogen activators, such as t-PA&nbsp;</strong>(option A).&nbsp;Furthermore, <strong>thrombomodulin&nbsp;</strong>(option B)&nbsp;binds to thrombin and converts it into an anti-coagulant. <strong>Prostacyclin</strong> (option D) is <strong>PGI<sub>2</sub></strong>.
