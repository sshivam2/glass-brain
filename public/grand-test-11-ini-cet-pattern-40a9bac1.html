The major families of proteins involved in adhesion and migration are <strong>selectins</strong> and <strong>integrins</strong> and their ligands.</li>\n<li><strong>Adhesions</strong>: The weak rolling interactions slow down the leucocytes and allow them to bind more firmly to the endothelium. <strong>Chemokines</strong> that were produced at the site of injury bind to the endothelial cell proteoglycans. These chemokines then bind to the rolling leucocytes and activate them. This, in turn, converts the ligands for\u00a0\u03b21 and\u00a0\u03b22 integrins, <strong>VLA-4,</strong> and <strong>LFA-1 </strong>present on the leucocytes to a <strong>high-affinity state</strong>.</li>\n<li>This combination of cytokine-induced expression of integrin ligands on the endothelium and increased integrin affinity on the leucocytes leads to firm <strong>adhesion</strong> of leucocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation.</li>\n<li>Leucocyte<strong> migration</strong>: This is the movement of leucocytes through the intact endothelium, called transmigration or diapedesis. This occurs in postcapillary venules. This migration occurs through the inter-endothelial gap towards the chemical concentration gradient created by the chemokines at the site of injury. This occurs with the help of adhesion molecules present in the intercellular junctions such as <strong>platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule</strong> (<strong>PECAM-1</strong>) or <strong>CD31</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>",

The attack generally lasts for up to half an hour but in some cases may last for more than an hour. Between attacks, the patient may suffer from anticipatory anxiety about the next attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder:</p>\n<p>A. <strong>Recurrent unexpected panic attacks</strong> which include\u00a0<strong>\u22654</strong> of the following\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palpitations</li>\n<li>Trembling</li>\n<li>Sweating</li>\n<li>Dyspnea</li>\n<li>Choking</li>\n<li>Chest pain</li>\n<li>Nausea, abdominal distress</li>\n<li>Chills, heat sensation</li>\n<li>Dizziness, light-headedness</li>\n<li>Paresthesias</li>\n<li>Derealization or depersonalization</li>\n<li>Fear of losing control</li>\n<li>Fear of death</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.

The attack cannot be explained by any other mental disorder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Treatment</p>\n<p>Presently, <strong>SSRIs</strong> are considered the first-line drugs for the treatment of panic disorder. <strong>Paroxetine</strong> is preferred due to its <strong>sedative</strong> <strong>effects</strong> which calm down patients immediately leading to better compliance. <strong>Citalopram</strong> or <strong>sertraline</strong> are viable alternatives as well. However, for an acute episode with\u00a0severe symptoms, benzodiazepines like <strong>alprazolam</strong> should be started <strong>concurrently</strong> <strong>with SSRIs</strong> and slowly tapered off. This is because benzodiazepines have the most rapid onset of action. Pharmacotherapy should generally continue for <strong>8-12 months</strong> when it is found to be effective.</p>\n<p>Other than pharmacotherapy, <strong>cognitive</strong> and <strong>behavior therapies</strong> are also very effective treatments for panic disorder. These work especially well when used in combination with pharmacotherapy. These help in producing <strong>long-lasting remissions</strong> of symptoms.</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Alprazolam</strong> is a benzodiazepine with a <strong>high risk of psychological</strong> and <strong>physical</strong> <strong>dependence</strong> if used in the long term. Therefore it is used as an adjunct to SSRIs or psychotherapy and not used as a primary treatment.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Phenelzine</strong> is a <strong>monoamine oxidase</strong> inhibitor. MAOIs may require certain dietary restrictions and hence are used less often.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Imipramine</strong> is a tricyclic anti-depressant that can be used for panic disorder as a second-line drug.\u00a0TCAs are used less often than SSRIs because they are associated with <strong>more adverse effects</strong> at the dosages\u00a0required for the treatment of panic disorder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

A chest CT is also able&nbsp;to differentiate between thymoma and lymphoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Anti-AChR antibodies </strong>seen in myasthenia gravis&nbsp;block acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic membrane.
