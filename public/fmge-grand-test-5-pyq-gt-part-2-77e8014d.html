The growth and survival of prostate cancer cells depend on <strong>androgens.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Approximately 70% of carcinomas of the prostate arise in the <strong>peripheral zone</strong> of the gland, classically in a <strong>posterior location.</strong></p>\n<p>Most cancers are clinically silent and are detected on routine rectal examination or PSA measurements.&nbsp;<strong>Grossly, </strong>malignant tissue is <strong>gritty&nbsp;</strong><strong>and firm</strong>&nbsp;in consistency (in contrast to the spongy appearance of benign tissue) and thus more readily palpable on <strong>digital rectal examination.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Local extension</strong> most commonly involves the periprostatic tissue, seminal vesicles, and the base of the urinary bladder. Metastasis spreads via the lymphatics to the <strong>obturator</strong> nodes and the <strong>para-aortic</strong> nodes.&nbsp;Hematogenous spread&nbsp;occurs chiefly through the&nbsp;<strong>bones</strong> to the <strong>axial skeleton</strong>&nbsp;and rarely to the viscera. The&nbsp;bony metastasis is <strong>blastic&nbsp;in origin</strong> and involves the <strong>lumbar spine, proximal femur, pelvis, thoracic spine, and ribs</strong> in decreasing order of frequency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Grading of prostate cancer by the <strong>modified Gleason system</strong> correlates with pathologic stage and prognosis.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 992\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Measurement of serum PSA levels is widely used to assist in the&nbsp;<strong>diagnosis, prognosis, and management of prostate cancer. &nbsp;</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Hence, giving another dose at a later time helps in killing the other cells that were in the resistant part of the cell cycle, thus increasing the success rate of the therapy.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Re-oxygenation</strong>: Hypoxic cells are less sensitive to the indirect effects of radiation. The tumor cells which are closer to oxygen sources are killed first and in the intervening time, the other relatively hypoxic cells can improve their oxygenation so that the next fraction of radiation is effective on them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Repair</strong>: The ability to repair DNA is more for healthy cells than malignant cells and thus when a radiation dose has been received, the healthy cells repair their DNA faster than the malignant cells.
