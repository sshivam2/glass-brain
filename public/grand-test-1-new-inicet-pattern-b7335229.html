As <strong>H<sup>+</sup> </strong>is<strong> usually exchanged </strong>with<strong> K<sup>+</sup></strong> from the lumen in the DCT, <strong>decreased H<sup>+</sup> secretion</strong> is also associated with <strong>decreased K<sup>+</sup> absorption</strong>, resulting in <strong>hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Acidosis</strong> reduces net <strong>proximal fluid reabsorption</strong>, which leads to <strong>volume contraction</strong> and <strong>activation </strong>of the<strong> renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system</strong> (RAAS). This results in <strong>decreased proximal tubular Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption</strong> and increased distal delivery of Na<sup>+</sup> to the cortical collecting duct. These processes, along with increased aldosterone secretion, leading to increased K<sup>+</sup> secretion by activation of ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) channels in the collecting duct thus causing <strong>hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ammonium</strong> produced as a result of glutamine metabolism is <strong>secreted in the proximal tubule</strong>, which <strong>normally combines with H<sup>+</sup> ions</strong> secreted in the alpha-intercalated cells of the distal tubule to form NH4<sup>+</sup> ions. Since this process is impaired in RTA-1, the <strong>urine anion gap (UAG) is positive</strong> due to <strong>low urine NH4<sup>+\u00a0</sup>concentration</strong>. RTA-1 is associated with <strong>hypercalciuria</strong> and with persistent alkaline urine it is a risk factor for developing <strong>calcium phosphate stones</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>Renal tubular acidosis - type 2</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>proximal RTA</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>occurs due to generalized <strong>proximal tubule dysfunction</strong>. Defective <strong>HCO<sup>3- </sup>resorption</strong> is the primary dysfunctional mechanism causing metabolic acidosis and is also associated with <strong>glycosuria, aminoaciduria, </strong>and<strong> phosphaturia. </strong></p>\n<p>In the initial stages of the disease or during HCO<sup>3- </sup>replacement the urine remains alkaline, but as\u00a0HCO<sup>3- </sup>losses continue, the <strong>urine turns acidic</strong> with <strong>pH &lt;5.5</strong>. There is no defect in the urine concentrating mechanism at the\u00a0cortical collecting tubule, thus\u00a0urine NH4<sup>+\u00a0</sup>concentration is normal and <strong>UAG </strong>is<strong> negative</strong>. There is no associated hypercalciuria.</p>\n<p>Option C-\u00a0<strong>Renal tubular acidosis - type 4\u00a0</strong>also known as <strong>pseudohypoaldosteronism\u00a0</strong>occurs due to end-organ resistance to aldosterone and is characterized by <strong>hyperkalemia</strong>, metabolic acidosis, and a <strong>positive UAG.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Alport syndrome</strong> is caused by mutations affecting <strong>type IV collagen</strong> that result in <strong>hematuria</strong> with progression to chronic renal failure, sensorineural deafness, and various eye disorders, including lens dislocation, posterior cataracts, and corneal dystrophy.</p>",
