Eg. if the examiner changes the position of a limb, the patient stays in that position for a long time.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Waxy flexibility</strong>- slight, even resistance to positioning by the examiner</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Mutism</strong>- no, or very little, a verbal response to instructions or external stimuli</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Negativism</strong>- opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong> Posturing</strong>- spontaneous and <strong>active maintenance</strong> of a posture against gravity. Patient themselves maintain that position.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Mannerism</strong>- odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Stereotypy</strong>- repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Agitation</strong>, not influenced by external stimuli</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Grimacing</strong></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Echolalia</strong>-mimicking another's speech</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Echopraxia</strong>- mimicking another's movement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The presence of <strong>three or more</strong> of these features is required for a diagnosis of catatonia.</p>\n<p>Treatment- The primary treatment of catatonia is to <strong>identify</strong> the <strong>underlying cause</strong> and treat it.
