Hartnup disease (<strong>pellagra like dermatosis</strong>) is an autosomal recessive condition caused due to a single defect in renal and intestinal&nbsp;<strong>transport of tryptophan</strong>&nbsp;and other&nbsp;monoamino monocarboxylic amino acids&nbsp;(neutral amino acids). This results in decreased availability of tryptophan for niacin synthesis. Thus, manifesting as pellagra like symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of the children are&nbsp;asymptomatic</li>\n<li>However, major clinical manifestation in the rare symptomatic patient is, cutaneous&nbsp;<strong>photosensitivity</strong></li>\n<li>The skin becomes rough and red after moderate exposure to the sun and with greater exposure, a&nbsp;<strong>pellagra-like rash&nbsp;</strong>may develop. The rash maybe&nbsp;<strong>pruritic</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>chronic eczema</strong>&nbsp;may also appear.</li>\n<li>Some patients may also have an&nbsp;<strong>intermittent ataxia,</strong>&nbsp;manifested as an unsteady wide based gait, which usually lasts for few days, and&nbsp;<strong>recovers spontaneously</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Urine testing for&nbsp;<strong>amino acids.</strong></li>\n<li>Diagnosis of Hartnup disease is made by showing the characteristic amino acid excretion pattern in urine.&nbsp;<strong>Indoles</strong>&nbsp;and other&nbsp;<strong>tryptophan degradation</strong>&nbsp;products in urine provide supplementary evidence of the disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Niacin&nbsp;or&nbsp;niacinamide supplements</li>\n<li>Nicotinamide&nbsp;for attacks</li>\n</ul>",

This reduction in the heart rate <strong>decreases the myocardial oxygen demand.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The oxygen requirement of the heart mainly depends on the work done by the heart. This work mainly depends on cardiac output and peripheral resistance. An increase in these parameters will increase the oxygen requirement of the heart.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Important determinants of cardiac output are:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Stroke volume</strong>- It is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat. This stroke volume increases whenever, there is <strong>increased venous</strong> return to the heart, increased end-diastolic volume (<strong>preload</strong>), and increased contractility. Contractility further depends on the <strong>initial length</strong> of the cardiac muscle fiber and the <strong>autonomic innervation.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Heart rate</strong>- Increased heart rate increases the cardiac output which in turn increases the oxygen requirement. Heart rate&nbsp;is controlled primarily by the autonomic nerves, with sympathetic stimulation increasing the rate and parasympathetic stimulation decreasing the rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afterload-</strong> The tension at which the load is lifted is called afterload. As the afterload increases, the heart has to work more in order to pump blood to the organs. This in turn results in increased oxygen requirement. It is dependent on the <strong>peripheral resistance.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Drugs used in the management of angina either decrease the work done by the heart or increases the blood flow to the heart.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Nitrates</strong>- They increase the cGMP and cause venodilation. It mainly results in an increase in venous capacitance and a decrease in the ventricular preload. They might also increase coronary flow in some areas and in variant anginas.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong>- Blocking the calcium channels leads to the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles and decreased impulses in the conduction system. This leads to decreased peripheral resistance,&nbsp;decreased blood pressure, decreased contractility, decreased heart rate, and decreased oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Beta-blockers</strong>- They decrease the oxygen requirement by decreasing the&nbsp;heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility.

However, levodopa can now be <strong>methylated</strong> by catechol-O-methyl transferase and get inactivated. This is prevented by catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors&nbsp;<strong>tolcapone </strong>and<strong> entacapone.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Parkinson's disease arises as a result of the <strong>loss of dopaminergic neurons</strong> in the <strong>striatum</strong>. Therefore the mainstay of treatment for this disease is to increase dopamine in this area.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A-&nbsp;<strong>Amantadine</strong> is an antiviral agent. It is used in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A. It has antiparkinsonian activity.&nbsp;It alters dopamine release in the striatum, has anticholinergic properties, and <strong>blocks methyl-D-aspartate</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>NMDA) receptors</strong>. It can be used in <strong>mild disease,&nbsp;dose-related fluctuations,&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>dyskinesia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B-&nbsp;<strong>Rotigotine</strong>&nbsp;is a dopamine receptor agonist. It acts on D1 and D2 receptors, whereas <strong>ropinirole</strong> and <strong>pramipexole</strong>&nbsp;act on the D2 and D3 receptors.&nbsp; The duration of action of the DA agonists (8&ndash;24 h) is often longer than that of levodopa (6&ndash;8 h). They are effective in the treatment of patients who have developed <strong>on/off phenomena</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Selegiline</strong>&nbsp;and rasagiline are&nbsp;<strong>selective</strong> <strong>monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors</strong>.&nbsp;Dopamine in the striatum is predominantly metabolized by the MAO-B enzyme. Inhibiting this enzyme will <strong>increase</strong> <strong>dopamine concentration</strong>&nbsp;in these neurons. They selectively and irreversibly inactivate MAO-B.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>Other drugs used in parkinsonism are:</p>\n<p><strong>Levodopa</strong> is a prodrug. It crosses the blood-brain barrier.&nbsp;<strong>Levodopa</strong> is converted to <strong>dopamine</strong> by decarboxylation in dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. It significantly improves the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</p>\n<p>An adverse effect of levodopa is the <strong>wearing-off phenomenon</strong>. After administrating levodopa, there is improvement in the symptoms for a period of 1&ndash;2 h, but rigidity and akinesia return rapidly after the effect of the drug reduces. Increasing the dose and frequency of administration can improve this phenomenon, but the patients often develop dyskinesia and excessive abnormal involuntary movements.</p>\n<p>In the later stages of the disease, patients may <strong>fluctuate rapidly</strong> between being &ldquo;<strong>off</strong>,&rdquo; having no beneficial effects from their medications, and being &ldquo;on&rdquo; having some beneficial effects but along with side effects.</p>\n<p>Levodopa, if administered alone will undergo decarboxylation by the decarboxylases present in the intestinal mucosa and other peripheral sites. This will lead to decreased concentration of the drug reaching the brain. In order to prevent this levodopa is always given with <strong>carbidopa</strong>.&nbsp;Carbidopa&nbsp;inhibits&nbsp;<strong>peripheral decarboxylase enzymes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Muscarinic receptor antagonists</strong>&nbsp;are used as adjuncts to dopamine therapy. Eg.&nbsp;<strong>trihexyphenidyl </strong>and<strong> benztropine</strong>. <strong>Diphenhydramine,</strong> an antihistamine is also used.</p>\n<p><strong>Apomorphine</strong> acts on D4 and mildly on D2, D3, and D5 receptors.
