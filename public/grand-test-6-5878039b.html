Expulsion tends to occur at the time of menstruation and is associated with cramping, bleeding, and vaginal discharge.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here the IUCD has caused perforation of the uterus and is lodged outside the uterus, hence,\u00a0<strong>spontaneous expulsion</strong> will <strong>not </strong>be <strong>possible.\u00a0</strong></p>",

The drug also is useful in the therapy of invasive aspergillosis particularly after the infection has been treated with amphotericin B.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Terbinafine</strong> <strong>inhibits fungal squalene epoxidase</strong> (point B) and reduces ergosterol biosynthesis.
