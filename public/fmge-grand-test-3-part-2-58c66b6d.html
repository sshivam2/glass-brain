Colonic diverticulosis is more common among the age group of more than 50 years. Colonic diverticulosis is primarily <strong>false diverticula</strong> as only the mucosa and muscularis mucosa have herniated. Due to the high intraluminal pressure, they are referred to as the pulsion type of diverticula.&nbsp;A low fibre diet results in smaller stool volume that increases intraluminal pressure for propulsion.
