Signs include <strong>primary deviation, secondary deviation</strong>, <strong>compensatory head tilt,</strong> and <strong>false projection/</strong>orientation.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary deviation</strong> is the <strong>deviation</strong> of the <strong>affected eye</strong> and it will deviate away from the action of the affected muscle, e.g.\u00a0<strong>Secondary deviation</strong> is the <strong>deviation</strong> of the <strong>normal eye</strong> when the patient fixates with the squinting eye.\u00a0<strong>Compensatory head posture</strong> means that the<strong> head tilts toward</strong> the action of the<strong> paralyzed muscle</strong>.\u00a0<strong>False projection</strong>/<strong>orientation</strong> occurs due to increased impulse conveyed to the paralyzed muscle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A<strong> forced duction test</strong> is done to differentiate between restrictive and paralytic squint. Apart from that, investigations done for all cases of strabismus (refractive error testing, cover test, etc) as well as <strong>diplopia charting</strong>,<strong>\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>Hess screen</strong>\u00a0<strong>test </strong>should also be done.</p>\n<p><strong>Diplopia</strong> is treated by using<strong> an occluder</strong> on the affected eye.\u00a0 <strong>Chemodenervation</strong> of the<strong> contralateral muscle</strong> using <strong>botulinum toxin</strong> and surgical treatment if there is no improvement after 6 months can also be done to manage the condition.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Accomodative esotropia</strong>\u00a0is a convergent squint that occurs as a result of <strong>overaction</strong> of <strong>convergence</strong> related to <strong>accommodation reflex</strong>. It is the most common type of squint present in children and develops around 2 - 3 years of age.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Restrictive squint</strong> occurs when there is <strong>a restriction</strong> to <strong>extraocular movement</strong> rather than paralysis of extraocular muscles. It can be seen in conditions such as <strong>thyroid ophthalmopathy</strong>, <strong>entrapped inferior rectus</strong> muscle in <strong>blow-out fracture</strong> and orbital mass lesions. <strong>Forced duction test</strong> will be <strong>positive</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Primary exotropia</strong> is a form of <strong>divergent squint</strong> and may be intermittent or constant.
