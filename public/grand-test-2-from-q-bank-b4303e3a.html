It occurs due to an<strong> error</strong> in the<strong> de novo synthesis</strong> of<strong> pyrimidine</strong> resulting in the failure of conversion of <strong>orotic acid</strong> to <strong>uridine</strong>. As a result, there is increased excretion of orotic acid in urine.&nbsp;It is of two types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type I - deficiency of both orotate phosphoribosyl transferase and OMP decarboxylase (together called UMPsynthase)</li>\n<li>Type II - deficiency of only orotidylate decarboxylase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Children clinically present with <strong>megaloblastic anemia</strong> that is <strong>unresponsive to vitamin B12 </strong>and <strong>folic acid</strong>, failure to thrive, <strong>developmental delay, </strong>and intellectual disability.</p>\n<p>Confirmation of the diagnosis requires an assay of the transferase and decarboxylase enzymes in the patient's red blood cells.

LP is considered <strong>contraindicated</strong> if the <strong>platelet count</strong> is <strong>less than 20,000/&mu;L</strong>, and some institutions recommend a platelet count of greater than 40,000/&mu;L before proceeding with the procedure.</p>\n<p><strong>Proper positioning</strong> of the patient is crucial for an LP. The patient should lie on their side away from the examiner, with their knees bent and pulled up toward the abdomen (<strong>lateral decubitus</strong>). The neck should be gently bent forward, and the shoulders and pelvis should be aligned vertically. LP is typically performed at or below the <strong>L3-L4 interspace</strong>, which can be identified by palpating the spinous processes and using a line drawn between the <strong>posterior superior iliac crests</strong> as a guide.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the LP can be done with the patient seated <strong>upright</strong>, leaning forward to flex the back.

The needle is advanced until the <strong>subarachnoid space</strong> (SAS) is reached indicated by a <strong>loss of resistance</strong>. Once the SAS is reached, the opening pressure is measured, and CSF is allowed to drip into collection tubes for analysis.</p>\n<p>A <strong>traumatic tap</strong>&nbsp;may cause a bloody tap, which can be differentiated from <strong>subarachnoid hemorrhage</strong> (SAH) by examining the supernatant after centrifugation.

Imaging studies should also include the spine in patients with symptoms suggestive of <strong>spinal cord compression</strong>, such as back pain, leg weakness, urinary retention, or incontinence. In cases where <strong>acute meningitis</strong> is suspected and neuroimaging is necessary before the LP, it is recommended to administer <strong>antibiotics,</strong>&nbsp;preferably <strong>after blood culture</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>before</strong> conducting the <strong>imaging</strong> study.</p>\n<p>The image below shows Quincke (dura cutting) and Whitacre (dura splitting) LP needles:</p>",
