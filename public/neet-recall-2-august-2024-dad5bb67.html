They may be considered in cases with comorbid psychotic symptoms, but this patient does not exhibit hallucinations or delusions.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Give fitness for surgery: </strong>Giving fitness for surgery would be inappropriate and potentially harmful. Surgery is not the solution for BDD, as patients typically remain dissatisfied with the results and continue seeking more surgeries.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Initiate insight-oriented psychotherapy: </strong>While psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is effective for BDD, insight-oriented psychotherapy (focused on understanding unconscious conflicts) is less effective than targeted approaches like CBT in managing this condition.</p>",

The image is that of septal perforation; <strong>SMR</strong> (Submucosal resection ) has a higher likelihood of causing the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Septal perforation</strong> can occur after nasal surgery. Features depend on the size of the perforation. Smaller perforations can present with whistling while the larger perforations will present with epistaxis and crust formation. Therefore, <strong>septoplasty</strong> has become a more favored treatment of DNS than SMR due to its conservative approach.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Septoplasty</strong> is a <strong>conservative</strong> technique in the surgical correction of septal deformity. The key advantage is that it can be carried out as a daycare procedure, most of the bone and cartilage are retained, and complications are less. The deformed septum may corrected by various techniques like scoring the concave side, shaving, and wedge excision. Sometimes realignment by joining straight pieces of the septum outside the nose and replacing them can be done which is called extra-corporeal septoplasty.</p>\n<p><strong>The indications for an SMR are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>DNS causing symptoms of nasal obstruction and recurrent headaches.</li>\n<li>DNS causing obstruction of paranasal sinuses and middle ear, resulting in recurrent sinusitis and otitis media.</li>\n<li>Recurrent epistaxis from a septal spur.</li>\n<li>As a part of septorhinoplasty, for cosmetic correction of external nasal deformities.</li>\n<li>As a preliminary step in hypophysectomy or vidian neurectomy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in children below 17 years of age, during acute respiratory infection, bleeding diathesis, untreated diabetes, or hypertension.</p>\n<p>In this procedure, mucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flaps are raised on <strong>both sides of the septum</strong>.

This is followed by <strong>extensive dissection</strong> of the septum removing all deformed bony and cartilaginous parts of the septum and preserving only a caudal and a dorsal strut of cartilage.</p>\n<p>There is a greater chance of <strong>complications</strong> associated with SMR that include bleeding, septal hematoma, septal abscess, <strong>perforation</strong>, depression of the nasal bridge, retraction of the columella, and persistence of the deviation.

It is usually caused by <em><strong>Clostridium difficile</strong></em>. The pathogenesis is mediated by the enterotoxins -<strong> toxin A</strong> and toxin B.</p>\n<p><em>Clostridium difficile</em> is a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that causes<strong>\u00a0<em>Clostridioides </em>(formerly\u00a0<em>Clostridium</em>)<em>\u00a0</em><em>difficile</em> infection</strong>\u00a0after ingestion of spores of the organism. The more severe form of the condition is known as <strong>pseudomembranous colitis</strong> (PMC).\u00a0Enzyme immunoassay to detect <strong>glutamate dehydrogenase</strong> is<strong> less specific</strong> compared to<strong> toxin detection</strong> for diagnosis. So a combination of the two can be used for diagnostic confirmation.</p>\n<p>The condition is most commonly associated with\u00a0<strong>prolonged antimicrobial use</strong>,\u00a0which interferes with the commensal colonic microflora. The most commonly implicated antibiotics are\u00a0cephalosporins,\u00a0ampicillin, and <strong>clindamycin.</strong> The spores are spread by contact with the\u00a0<strong>feces</strong>\u00a0of affected individuals or asymptomatic carriers. It can persist on surfaces for months. Risk factors include\u00a0<strong>poor hand hygiene</strong>, old age, and gastrointestinal surgery.</p>\n<p>The spores germinate in the small intestine and produce two toxins\u2014<strong>toxin A</strong>\u00a0(enterotoxin) and\u00a0<strong>toxin B</strong>\u00a0(cytotoxin). These interfere with the epithelial-cell barrier function and result in diarrhea and\u00a0<strong>pseudomembrane</strong>\u00a0formation. The pseudomembranes appear as small whitish-yellow plaques initially which later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall. It contains\u00a0<strong>necrotic leukocytes</strong>,<strong>\u00a0fibrin</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>cellular debris</strong>. The<strong>\u00a0anamnestic IgG response</strong>\u00a0determines which patients develop the disease or remain asymptomatic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Symptoms include<strong>\u00a0diarrhea</strong>, fever, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is based on a combination of <strong>clinical criteria</strong> and detection of <strong>toxin</strong> or the <strong>organism</strong> in stool samples.

Variants of FAP are Gardner and Turcot syndromes. Its features are described in the pearl attached.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Esophageal varices </strong>(image 4) are tortuous <strong>dilated veins </strong>within the mucosa and submucosa of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach. Variceal hemorrhage is an emergency that can be treated medically by inducing splanchnic vasoconstriction or endoscopically by sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade, or variceal ligation. It commonly occurs due to portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option D:\u00a0<strong>Ulcerative colitis</strong> (UC) (image 2) which is characterized by continuous inflammation of the colon, <strong>pseudopolyps</strong>, biopsy findings of crypt distortion, ulceration, and infiltration of inflammatory cells until the submucosal layer of the intestinal wall. Diagnosis can be made by colonoscopy followed by a biopsy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>UC is a type of <strong>inflammatory bowel disease</strong> that primarily affects the rectum and extends proximally to involve the colon. Patients typically present with diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, crampy abdominal pain, and mucus discharge.

    "solution": "<p>The patient's presentation of <strong>tachypnea, hypotension, high anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong>, and <strong>hypocalcemia</strong>, is suggestive of <strong>ethylene glycol poisoning</strong>.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol is a clear, colourless, and odourless liquid commonly used as an <strong>antifreeze</strong>. It is known for its <strong>bitter-sweet taste</strong> and is absorbed mainly through<strong> ingestion</strong> rather than skin contact. Upon ingestion, ethylene glycol is <strong>metabolized</strong> in the <strong>liver</strong> to several toxic metabolites, including <strong>glycolic acid</strong> and <strong>oxalic acid</strong>, which contribute to its harmful effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Initially</strong>, ethylene glycol poisoning can cause symptoms such as <strong>vomiting, lethargy</strong>, and <strong>ataxia</strong>, progressing to severe effects including tachycardia, tachypnea, and <strong>circulatory collapse</strong> within <strong>12-24 hours</strong>. As the condition progresses, typically within one to three days, patients may experience hypocalcemia, <strong>oliguria, tubular necrosis</strong>, and <strong>acute kidney injury (AKI</strong>). A notable feature of ethylene glycol poisoning is the formation of <strong>calcium oxalate crystals</strong> in the<strong> urine</strong>, which can lead to <strong>renal failure</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>postmortem findings</strong>\u00a0often include <strong>cerebral edema, chemical meningoencephalitis</strong>, and significant damage to the liver and kidneys. <strong>Oxalate crystals</strong> may be observed in the <strong>brain, spinal cord</strong>, and kidneys, further confirming the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>For treatment, immediate measures include <strong>gastric lavage, activated charcoal</strong>, and administration of ethanol or <strong>4-methyl pyrazole (fomepizole)</strong>, which inhibit the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to prevent further metabolism of ethylene glycol into toxic compounds. Additional treatments such as <strong>intravenous sodium bicarbonate</strong> and <strong>calcium gluconate</strong> are used to address metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia, respectively, while <strong>hemodialysis</strong> is indicated in <strong>severe</strong> <strong>cases</strong> with significant renal impairment or high serum ethylene glycol concentrations.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Methyl alcohol (Methanol)</strong> and Ethylene glycol poisoning can present very similarly. However, the key distinguishing feature of methanol poisoning is the presence of <strong>eye symptoms</strong> (as opposed to kidney damage in ethylene glycol) - like <strong>blurring</strong> of vision/<strong>loss of vision</strong> due to <strong>retinal damage</strong> by formate metabolites.</p>\n<p>Methanol--Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) \u21d2 <strong>Formaldehyde</strong> \u21d2 (<strong>Retinal damage</strong>)</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol--Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) \u21d2 <strong>Glyoxyaldehyde</strong> \u21d2 (<strong>Kidney damage</strong>)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Datura</strong> is used as a <strong>stupefying poison</strong> before robbery, kidnapping, and rape. The active ingredients include the <strong>anticholinergic alkaloids atropine, scopolamine</strong>, and <strong>hyoscyamine</strong>. The <strong>seeds </strong>or other parts of the plant can be ingested or smoked. <strong>Toxic manifestations</strong>\u00a0include dilatation of pupils along with <strong>loss of accommodation, diplopia, dryness</strong> of the mouth and throat, unquenchable thirst, dysphagia, dilatation of cutaneous blood vessels, <strong>dysarthria</strong>, drunken gait, delirium, drowsiness and death due to <strong>respiratory</strong> or <strong>cardiac failure.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Digoxin toxicity</strong> can occur in the elderly and patients with renal impairment and presents with <strong>nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea</strong>, confusion, blurred vision with a characteristic <strong>yellowing of vision</strong> (compared to the \u201cstarry night\u201d painting), and <strong>irregular heart rhythms</strong>. Overdose and resultant arrhythmias are managed with <strong>anti-digoxin Fab fragments (Digibind</strong> or <strong>Digifab</strong>).</p>",
