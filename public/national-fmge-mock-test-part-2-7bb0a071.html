Invasive growth into the sinuses or orbit can lead to <strong>proptosis</strong>, diplopia, and lacrimation.</p>\n<p>On <strong>nasal endoscopy</strong>, it appears as a <strong>pale polypoidal mass</strong> resembling a nasal polyp. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to determine the<strong> location </strong>and <strong>extent</strong> of the lesion.

They can occur in children, most commonly around<strong> 3 -5 years </strong>of age (juvenile papillomatosis), as well as in adults.
