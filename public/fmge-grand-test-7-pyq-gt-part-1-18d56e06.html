Mucormycosis recently emerged as an important&nbsp;<strong>superinfection</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>COVID-19</strong>&nbsp;patients, especially in India. The surge in cases is most likely due to <strong>diabetes mellitus </strong>and <strong>steroid use</strong>.</p>\n<p>Risk factors for the infection include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uncontrolled&nbsp;<strong>diabetes</strong></li>\n<li>Acidosis (especially <strong>diabetic ketoacidosis</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>Steroid treatment</strong></li>\n<li>Lymphomas and leukemias</li>\n<li>Immunodeficiencies</li>\n<li>Severe burns&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>rhino-orbital-cerebral</strong>&nbsp;is the most common form of mucormycosis. Patients present with&nbsp;<strong>rhinitis</strong>, eye or&nbsp;<strong>facial</strong>&nbsp;<strong>pain,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>facial</strong>&nbsp;<strong>numbness</strong>&nbsp;followed by the onset of&nbsp;<strong>conjunctival</strong>&nbsp;<strong>suffusion</strong>&nbsp;and swelling along with&nbsp;<strong>blurry vision.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Patients can have local tissue destruction with <strong>blackish nasal discharge</strong> typically resembling the presentation of&nbsp;<strong>invasive mucormycosis</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>blackish discoloration</strong>&nbsp;is due to&nbsp;<strong>direct fungal invasion</strong>&nbsp;causing&nbsp;<strong>arterial and venous thrombosis</strong>&nbsp;leading to&nbsp;<strong>gangrene.</strong></p>\n<p>Diagnosis is made by&nbsp;<strong>biopsy</strong>&nbsp;with histopathologic examination. The biopsy shows characteristic <strong>wide</strong>, <strong>ribbon-like aseptate hyphal elements</strong> that branch at&nbsp;<strong>right angles.</strong></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span class=\"s1\">The below image shows biopsy findings seen in mucormycosis.</span></span></p>",

This results in excessive Ach causing excessive muscarinic activity. It has relatively insignificant action on nicotinic receptors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Organophosphates and carbamates are powerful acetylcholinesterase&nbsp;inhibitors. While carbamates bind reversibly, organophosphates bind irreversibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The predominant initial signs are of&nbsp;<strong>muscarinic</strong>&nbsp;excess which includes:&nbsp;<strong>(DUMBBELSS)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diarrhea</strong></li>\n<li><strong>U</strong>rination</li>\n<li><strong>M</strong>iosis</li>\n<li><strong>B</strong>ronchospasm</li>\n<li><strong>B</strong>radycardia</li>\n<li><strong>E</strong>mesis</li>\n<li><strong>L</strong>acrimation</li>\n<li><strong>S</strong>alivation</li>\n<li><strong>S</strong>weating</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nicotinic manifestations</strong>&nbsp;include twitching of eyelids, tongue, and facial muscles which then leads to paralysis.&nbsp;<strong>CNS stimulation</strong>&nbsp;results in headaches, tremors, ataxia, coma, and death.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patients who present with organophosphate and carbamate poisoning require early endotracheal intubation to avoid respiratory depression, which is a common complication. Succinylcholine is avoided due to its metabolism by acetylcholinesterase which leads to prolonged neuromuscular blockade.&nbsp;</p>",
