It is greatly affected by sex, body habitus, and posture. It reduces from standing or sitting to supine and even furthermore in the prone position.

Hematuria and diminished concentrating ability (hyposthenuria) are the most common abnormalities seen in sickle cell nephropathy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It occurs due to the\u00a0accelerated sickling in the hypertonic hypoxic background of the renal medulla. The hyperosmolarity dehydrates red cells and increases intracellular sickle hemoglobin (HbS) concentrations.\u00a0 This leads to infarcts in the medulla and papillae and causes <strong>renal</strong> <strong>papillary</strong> <strong>necrosis</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Sickle cell anemia</strong> is an autosomal recessive disorder. It occurs\u00a0when negatively charged <strong>glutamine </strong>is<strong> replaced </strong>by a<strong> neutral valine</strong> at the sixth position of the <strong>beta-globin chain</strong>. This causes\u00a0deoxygenated hemoglobin to self-associate into long polymers that sickle the red cell.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaso-occlusive crises</strong> are episodes of hypoxic injury and infraction that causes severe pain in the affected region in sickle cell anemia. Bones, lungs, liver, brain, spleen, penis are the most commonly affected sites.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Hand-foot syndrome</strong> or dactylitis of bones of the hand and feet is a painful bones crisis that occurs in children. It is difficult to distinguish it from acute osteomyelitis.\u00a0<strong>Acute chest syndrome</strong> is the vaso-occlusive type of crisis involving the lungs that typically present with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates.\u00a0<strong>Priapism</strong> occurs in less than half of affected males after puberty and leads to hypoxic damage and erectile dysfunction.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Sequestration crisis</strong> occurs in the intact spleen of children. Sickled red cells get entrapped in the spleen which leads to rapid splenomegaly and hypovolemia. Transient cessation of erythropoiesis and sudden worsening of the anemia occurs in <strong>aplastic crisis</strong> in sickle cell patients with <strong>parvovirus B19</strong> infection.\u00a0</p>",

To compare potency of two drugs, the concentration required to achieve half the maximal response, usually denoted as EC50 is commonly used. Therefore, drug with lesser EC50 is more potent.</p>\n<p><strong>Efficacy</strong> is the ability of a drug to produce the maximal desired response. A drug with high efficacy may be a <strong>full agonist,</strong> which produces a <strong>full response</strong>\u00a0(100%)<strong>,</strong> while, a drug with lower efficacy may be a <strong>partial agonist,</strong> which <strong>doesn't produce a full response </strong>(between 0% and 100%)\u00a0at any dose. An <strong>antagonist</strong> is a drug that binds to a receptor and exhibits <strong>zero efficacy\u00a0</strong>(0%).</p>\n<p>In the given example, Drugs A and B are full agonists, thus they are more efficacious than drugs C and D.</p>\n<p>Among the drugs A and B, drug B has the least EC-50, hence is more potent than drug A.</p>\n<p>Therefore, drug B is the most efficacious and potent.</p>",
