The \"second hit\" is due to methylation abnormalities and inactivation of the normal \u03b2-catenin. The loss of the second APC allele follows the \"second hit.\" Mutations of <strong>KRAS </strong>on chromosome 12p12, <strong>TP53</strong> on chromosome 17p13, and LOH at chromosome 18q21 are also involved in further steps of the classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence.<br />\u00a0<br /><strong>Microsatellite instability pathway (MSI) </strong>occurs in patients with DNA mismatch repair deficiency, leading to the accumulation of mutations in microsatellite repeats.
