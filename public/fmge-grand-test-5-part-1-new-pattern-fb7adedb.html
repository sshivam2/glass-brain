On staining, they are sometimes seen arranged in a characteristic '<strong>school of fish</strong>' or <strong>'railroad track'</strong> appearance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clinically, patients develop an H. ducreyi infection from <strong>sexual contact </strong>with an infected person. Following this, they develop a papule that progresses to a pustule and finally a <strong>circumscribed ulcer</strong>. This is called chancroid or 'soft sore' and it may be single or multiple, very painful, bleeds easily, and is non-indurated. The infection then spreads to the lymph nodes which become tender, inflamed, and then suppurated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Diagnosis is established by isolating the organism on culture. The specimen may include scrapings from the ulcer base and aspirate from the suppurated lymph node. Culture is difficult but they can be grown on <strong>chocolate agar enriched with IsoVitaleX </strong>and vancomycin, fresh clotted rabbit blood, or on the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo. H. ducreyi requires media enriched with the <strong>X factor,</strong> but <strong>not the V factor</strong> for growth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Treatment is with a single oral dose of <strong>1g </strong>of <strong>azithromycin</strong>.

These antibodies are produced by <strong>hybridoma</strong> <strong>technology</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this technology, the B-lymphocytes of mice spleen are immunized with an antigen to produce a specific antibody. These specific antibody-producing B lymphocytes are then <strong>fused</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>myeloma</strong> <strong>cells</strong> that can multiply indefinitely.</p>\n<p>The myeloma cells are <strong>deficient</strong> in the hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (<strong>HGPRT</strong>) gene and do not produce immunoglobulins. Therefore, the resulting hybrid cell is producing antibodies against a single antigen indefinitely. These <strong>hybrid</strong> <strong>cells</strong> are <strong>cultured</strong> in a <strong>HAT</strong> <strong>medium</strong> (containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) and the monoclonal antibodies are obtained. It is well-established that nucleotides present in DNA and RNA consist of purine and pyrimidine bases. The synthesis of these nucleotides can occur through <strong>either</strong> the <strong>De</strong> <strong>novo</strong> pathway <strong>or</strong> the <strong>salvage</strong> <strong>pathway</strong>. Consequently, the inclusion of <strong>aminopterin</strong> in the HAT medium effectively <strong>inhibits</strong> the <strong>De</strong> <strong>novo</strong> pathway, thereby rendering the <strong>synthesis</strong> of <strong>purine</strong> <strong>dependent</strong> <strong>on</strong> the <strong>salvage</strong> <strong>pathway</strong>. However, it should be noted that the <strong>Salvage</strong> <strong>pathway</strong> exclusively takes place in the presence of the enzymes <strong>HGPRT</strong> and <strong>thymidine</strong> <strong>kinase</strong>. The hybridoma cell is <strong>uniquely capable</strong> of <strong>proliferating</strong> on the <strong>HAT</strong> <strong>medium</strong> due to its <strong>distinct</strong> <strong>composition</strong>. Specifically, the myeloma component of the <strong>hybridoma</strong> possesses the capacity for <strong>repetitive</strong> <strong>cellular</strong> <strong>division</strong>, while the <strong>plasma</strong> <strong>cell</strong> component <strong>contains</strong> the enzyme <strong>HGPRT.</strong> Consequently, the hybridoma cells can <strong>sustain</strong> <strong>growth</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>viability</strong> over an extended period when cultivated on the HAT medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Hybridoma technology</strong> is a method for producing <strong>large</strong> <strong>numbers</strong> of <strong>identical</strong> <strong>antibodies</strong> (monoclonal antibodies).</p>\n<p><strong>Hybridomas</strong> are somatic cell hybrids produced by <strong>fusing</strong> the <strong>antibody</strong>-<strong>forming</strong> <strong>spleen</strong> <strong>cells</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>myeloma</strong> <strong>cells</strong>.

The disease shows genetic anticipation and has an early-onset (second to the third decade) if inherited from the father. Cognitive impairment is an early feature.

The polynucleotide sequence involved in the expansion is the <strong>CTG</strong> sequence. This leads to an abnormal expression of<strong> myotonin protein kinase</strong>. In the childhood form of DM,intellectual disability and behavioural problems are often the predominant features.
