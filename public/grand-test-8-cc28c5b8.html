It occurs more commonly in a sporadic pattern but can be associated with <strong>MEN-1 </strong>(multiple endocrine neoplasia-1) syndromes in the familial pattern. Gastrinoma is <strong>most commonly located</strong> in the <strong>gastrinoma triangle </strong>(Passaro's triangle) bounded by the lines connecting the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cystic duct</li>\n<li>the junction between the second and third parts of the duodenum</li>\n<li>the junction between the neck and body of the pancreas</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most common presentations of gastrinoma are epigastric pain, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. The ulcers occur at typical locations (proximal duodenum) and atypical locations (distal duodenum, jejunum). <strong>Duodenal ulcers</strong> are the <strong>most common.</strong>&nbsp;Gastrinoma if associated with marked gastric acid production and recurrent peptic ulcer is called <strong>Zollinger Ellison syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p>Diagnosis:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>gastric pH &lt;2</strong>, <strong>basal acid output &gt;15 mEq/hr</strong> and <strong>serum gastrin concentration more than 1000 pg/ml&nbsp;</strong>(normal is &lt;100 pg/ml) confirms the diagnosis of gastrinoma. When the diagnosis is in doubt (like gastrin levels 100-1000 pg/ml), then a secretin test is performed. Secretin test is considered positive when serum<strong> gastrin levels</strong> are <strong>more than 200 pg/ml</strong> on <strong>secretin administration</strong> and confirms the diagnosis of gastrinoma.</p>\n<p>For <strong>localization</strong> of the tumor for surgical management, CT or MRI scans should be done first. If the tumor is not localized on these scans, then <strong>somatostatin receptor scintigraphy</strong> or <strong>endoscopic ultrasound</strong> are done for better localization.</p>\n<p>Treatment:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Medical- The primary goal is to reduce gastric acid secretion and relieve the symptoms. <strong>Proton pump inhibitors</strong> and <strong>octreotide</strong> are given to control the acid hypersecretion. In cases of metastatic gastrinomas, systemic <strong>chemotherapy</strong> comprising of streptozocin in combination with 5-fluorouracil or doxorubicin is given.</p>\n<p>Surgical- In pancreatic gastrinomas, <strong>enucleation</strong> with <strong>peripancreatic lymph node dissection</strong> is the procedure of choice. In duodenal gastrinomas, enucleation with the overlying mucosa is done for tumors &lt;5 cm and enucleation with full-thickness excision of the duodenal wall is done for tumors &gt;5 cm.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A-&nbsp;<strong>Insulinomas</strong>&nbsp;are the most common pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. They are characterized by symptoms of hypoglycemia, low plasma glucose at the time of symptoms, and relief of symptoms on glucose consumption. This is known as the <strong>Whipple's triad.</strong> C peptide levels of more than 1.2&nbsp;&mu;g/ml with a glucose level of &lt;40 mg/dl are highly suggestive of insulinoma. The gold standard for the diagnosis of insulinoma is the 72-hour monitored fast.</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Somatostatinoma</strong> is also a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor characterized by steatorrhea, diabetes mellitus, hypochlorhydria, and gallstones.

It is caused by<em> <strong>Corynebacterium</strong> <strong>minutissimum</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>Erythrasma is a mild, chronic, superficial infection of the skin. It affects the <strong>axillae</strong>, groins, toe webs, inter-gluteal and submammary regions. Lesions may be symptomless or show mild discomfort and itching.</p>\n<p>The lesions may be of <strong>irregular shape</strong> with <strong>sharp margins</strong>. They may start as smooth, red patches and then become brown. The lesions are more likely to be <strong>pruritic</strong> in the tropical regions and may be asymptomatic in the temperate climate.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Coral\u2010red fluorescence</strong> with Wood\u2019s light is due to <strong>coproporphyrin III</strong> and suggests erythrasma. The fluorescence may persist after the eradication of the disease.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Treatment is required otherwise the lesions may persist with fluctuations in severity. Treatment involves <strong>topical clotrimazole </strong>and<strong> miconazole</strong> for two weeks. For more extensive lesions, <strong>erythromycin</strong> can be administered. Relapse can occur. In these cases, long-term povidone-iodine administered topically with drying agents are given. Photodynamic therapy can also be attempted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other options:<br /><br />Option A: <strong>Corynebacterium diphtheria</strong> causes <strong>diphtheria</strong> and the typical lesion early in the disease is a superficial ulcer, oval, rounded, or irregularly linear in shape with a clearly defined, overhanging edge. The ulcer may later become deeper and the edge becomes rolled, raised, and avascular. It is usually seen around the umbilicus, behind the ears, genito-crural flexure, or in the clefts.</p>\n<p>Option C:\u00a0<strong>Corynebacterium tenuis</strong> can give rise to <strong>trichomycosis axillaris</strong>, a superficial infection of axillary and pubic hairs with the formation of an adherent granular nodule which can be yellow, black, or red in color, on the hair shaft.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Bacillus anthracis</strong> causes <strong>anthrax</strong>, which upon introduction of endospores into areas of exposed skin like the face, neck, hands, or arms gives rise to a typical 'malignant pustule'. It starts as a papule that turns into a bulla on erythematous skin which ruptures to form a <strong>hemorrhagic crust</strong> surrounded by edema, erythema, and vesicles. The lesions may be single or many.</p>",

It does not affect any other enzymes of the purine or pyrimidine metabolic pathway. It is indicated in the treatment of <strong>hyperuricemia</strong> in <strong>gouty patients.</strong> Febuxostat is more potent than allopurinol.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, diarrhea, joint pain, and rash. A flare in the gout attack can be seen during the initiation of therapy due to a decrease in serum uric acid levels that results in the mobilization of uric acid from tissue deposits.</p>\n<p>Drugs used in the management of gout can be classified as:</p>\n<p>Drugs that\u00a0<strong>relieve inflammation and pain</strong>- These drugs are useful in the management of\u00a0<strong>acute attacks of gout</strong>. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>NSAIDs</strong>-\u00a0They mainly exert their antiinflammatory action by <strong>inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzyme</strong> (COX).\u00a0This enzyme converts arachidonic acid to\u00a0prostanoids, thromboxane A2, and other prostaglandins</li>\n<li><strong>Colchicine</strong>-\u00a0It arrests the cell division by interfering with microtubule and spindle formation. This results in decreased neutrophil recruitment decreased neutrophil motility and decreased release of chemotactic factors.\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Glucocorticoids</strong>- These drugs bind to the nuclear receptors and decrease the transcription of genes for\u00a0COX-2, inducible NOS (NOS2), inflammatory cytokines, collagenase, etc, that are responsible for inflammation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drugs that <strong>inhibit urate formation</strong>- These drugs inhibit urate formation by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase.
