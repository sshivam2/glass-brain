When patients' chances of PE are high, the patient should be assessed for D-dimer levels. Normal levels of D-dimer rule out the possibility of PE. <strong>If </strong>the <strong>D-dimer</strong> levels are <strong>elevated,</strong> then the <strong>chances of pulmonary embolism </strong>are very <strong>high </strong>and the <strong>patient should undergo imaging</strong> to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>CT of the chest</strong> with <strong>intravenous contrast</strong> is the <strong>principal imaging test</strong> for the diagnosis of PE. It can provide exquisite detail, with &le;1 mm of resolution during a short breath-hold. It also helps to visualize the chambers of the heart. In patients who do not have a pulmonary embolism, it can also help in identifying alternative diagnoses like emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary mass, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Because of the invasive nature of pulmonary angiography (option B) and availability of chest CT scans, it is not commonly used in the diagnosis of PE. It is reserved for patients with technically unsatisfactory chest CTs and for those for whom an interventional procedure such as catheter-directed thrombolysis is planned.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lung scanning</strong> has become a <strong>second-line</strong> diagnostic test for PE, in patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast. Small particulate aggregates of albumin labeled with a gamma-emitting radionuclide are injected intravenously and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed. The perfusion scan defect indicates absent or decreased blood flow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>MR pulmonary angiography</strong> is a reliable test to identify deep vein thrombosis. It may detect large proximal PE, but is not reliable for smaller segmental and subsegmental PE.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most patients with PE have a normal echocardiogram (option D). Therefore, it is not a reliable test to detect PE. However, it can be used to detect other conditions that commonly mimic PE like acute myocardial infarction, pericardial tamponade, and aortic dissection.</p>",

It is an&nbsp;<strong>anterior tension-free mesh repair</strong>&nbsp;that reduces the chances of&nbsp;<strong>recurrence</strong>&nbsp;of a hernia.

It is used only in cases of hernial strangulation and peritonitis where the use of a mesh is not preferred. It is performed by&nbsp;<strong>suturing</strong>&nbsp;the transversus abdominis and internal oblique musculoaponeurotic arches/<strong>conjoined tendons</strong>&nbsp;to the<strong>&nbsp;inguinal ligament</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Shouldice repair</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>multilayered repair,</strong>&nbsp;where the posterior wall of the inguinal canal is strengthened by&nbsp;<strong>continuous sutures.</strong>&nbsp;It involves&nbsp;<strong>double-breasting</strong>&nbsp;of the<strong>&nbsp;transversalis fascia</strong>. It is associated with a&nbsp;<strong>very low recurrence rate.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gilbert repair</strong>&nbsp;(plug and patch repair) is an&nbsp;<strong>extension</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Lichtenstein&rsquo;s original mesh repair</strong>&nbsp;and has now become the&nbsp;<strong>most commonly</strong>&nbsp;performed&nbsp;<strong>primary anterior inguinal hernia repair</strong>. In this technique, a&nbsp;<strong>cone-shaped plug</strong>&nbsp;of<strong>&nbsp;polypropylene mesh</strong>&nbsp;is used. It is deployed like an upside-down umbrella when inserted into the internal inguinal ring to occlude the hernia</p>\n<p><strong>McVay repair&nbsp;</strong>(Cooper's ligament repair)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is used for the correction of direct inguinal hernia, large indirect hernia,<strong>&nbsp;recurrent hernia</strong>, femoral hernias (particularly suited for&nbsp;<strong>strangulated femoral hernias</strong>). In this method, the&nbsp;transversus abdominis aponeurosis is approximated to Cooper's ligament.</p>\n<p><strong>Stoppa-Rives repair&nbsp;</strong>is used for the repair of large, recurrent, or bilateral hernias.
