REM sleep is characterized by a high level of brain activity.&nbsp;REM sleep refers to rapid, roving eye movements that occur during this stage of sleep and are recorded as an electrooculogram (EOG). The EEG in REM sleep shows rapid, low-voltage activity with <strong>sawtooth waves</strong> and a <strong>pontogeniculo-occipital spike</strong>, which refers to large phasic potentials originating in the cholinergic neurons of the pons and passing rapidly to the lateral geniculate body and then to the occipital cortex.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During<strong> REM sleep</strong>, except for eye movement, there is almost a <strong>complete loss of skeletal muscle ton</strong>e. The threshold for arousal from sleep by sensory stimuli is increased during this time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NREM sleep is composed of stages 1 through 4. About 90 minutes after sleep onset, NREM yields to the first REM episode of the night. Non-REM sleep is divided into four stages:</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong>: The transition from wakefulness to sleep. EEG shows a low-voltage, <strong>mixed frequency</strong> pattern. A <strong>theta rhythm</strong> (4&ndash;7 Hz) is seen during this stage with <strong>vertex sharp waves</strong>. There are slow eye movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Presence of sinusoidal waves called <strong>sleep spindles</strong> (7&ndash;15 Hz) and <strong>K complexes</strong> which are negative sharp waves followed by a positive slow wave. There are no eye movements, muscle tone is reduced. (image 2)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong>: Presence of a <strong>high-amplitude delta rhythm</strong> (0.5&ndash;4 Hz). There is a further reduction in muscle tone and arousal, no eye movements. (image 3)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong>: A characteristic pattern of <strong>rhythmic slow waves</strong>, sometimes referred to as slow-wave sleep. While the occurrence of <strong>theta and delta</strong> <strong>rhythms</strong> is normal during sleep. No eye movements, low muscle tone.</p>\n<p><strong>Wakefulness</strong>:&nbsp;Low-voltage, mixed frequency activity. When eyes are closed, alpha activity is noted. (image 1) Eye movements and eye blinks are present, with high muscle tonic activity and voluntary movements.</p>",

When patients' chances of PE are high, the patient should be assessed for D-dimer levels. Normal levels of D-dimer rule out the possibility of PE. <strong>If </strong>the <strong>D-dimer</strong> levels are <strong>elevated,</strong> then the <strong>chances of pulmonary embolism </strong>are very <strong>high </strong>and the <strong>patient should undergo imaging</strong> to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>CT of the chest</strong> with <strong>intravenous contrast</strong> is the <strong>principal imaging test</strong> for the diagnosis of PE. It can provide exquisite detail, with &le;1 mm of resolution during a short breath-hold. It also helps to visualize the chambers of the heart. In patients who do not have a pulmonary embolism, it can also help in identifying alternative diagnoses like emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary mass, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Because of the invasive nature of pulmonary angiography (option B) and availability of chest CT scans, it is not commonly used in the diagnosis of PE.

Small particulate aggregates of albumin labeled with a gamma-emitting radionuclide are injected intravenously and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed. The perfusion scan defect indicates absent or decreased blood flow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>MR pulmonary angiography</strong> is a reliable test to identify deep vein thrombosis. It may detect large proximal PE, but is not reliable for smaller segmental and subsegmental PE.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most patients with PE have a normal echocardiogram (option D). Therefore, it is not a reliable test to detect PE. However, it can be used to detect other conditions that commonly mimic PE like acute myocardial infarction, pericardial tamponade, and aortic dissection.</p>",
