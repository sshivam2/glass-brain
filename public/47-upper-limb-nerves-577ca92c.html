    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ulnar nerve The Froment test is positive in cases of ulnar nerve palsy. The ulnar nerve innervates the adductor pollicis muscle, which is responsible for adduction of the thumb. During the Froment test, the patient is asked to hold a piece of paper between the thumb and the index finger while the examiner attempts to pull it away. In ulnar nerve lesions, the weakened adductor pollicis cannot generate sufficient force to hold the paper, causing the patient to compensate by flexing the thumb at the interphalangeal joint using the flexor pollicis longus, which is innervated by the median nerve. This compensatory movement is called a positive Froment sign. Incorrect Responses: (A) Radial nerve The radial nerve primarily innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm, wrist, and fingers. It does not play a role in thumb adduction or flexion. Therefore, a radial nerve lesion would not cause a positive Froment test. Instead, it would result in issues such as wrist drop or weakened extension of the hand and fingers.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Posterior interosseous nerve The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) is a branch of the radial nerve that innervates the extensor muscles of the fingers (extensor digitorum, extensor indicis, and extensor digiti minimi). A lesion of the PIN leads to finger drop, where the patient is unable to extend the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. However, the wrist extensors (extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis), which are innervated by the radial nerve proximal to the PIN, remain functional. This preserves wrist extension, resulting in finger drop without wrist drop. Incorrect Responses: (A) Radial nerve in the radial groove A lesion of the radial nerve in the radial groove would result in both wrist drop and finger drop. This is because the radial nerve supplies the wrist extensors (extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis) before it divides into its branches. Damage at this level affects both finger and wrist extension, making this option incorrect. (C) Anterior interosseous nerve The anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) is a branch of the median nerve that innervates the flexor pollicis longus, the lateral half of the flexor digitorum profundus, and the pronator quadratus. A lesion here would cause weakness in finger flexion (specifically at the distal interphalangeal joints of the index and middle fingers) and thumb flexion, but not finger or wrist extension. This makes it unrelated to finger drop. (D) Ulnar nerve behind medial epicondyle The ulnar nerve innervates muscles involved in fine motor control of the hand and some flexors of the forearm. A lesion of the ulnar nerve causes a claw hand deformity and weakness in ulnar-sided hand movements but does not affect finger or wrist extension. Therefore, it does not cause finger drop.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Posterior interosseous nerve The posterior interosseous nerve is a continuation of the deep branch of the radial nerve, and it is responsible for innervating the extensor muscles of the forearm, including the extensor digitorum. This muscle plays a critical role in extending the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of the fingers. Injury to the posterior interosseous nerve results in the loss of MCP joint extension while sparing wrist extension (due to the innervation of extensor carpi radialis longus by the radial nerve before it branches). This makes the posterior interosseous nerve the correct answer for loss of MCP extension. Incorrect Responses: (A) Median nerve The median nerve primarily innervates the muscles in the anterior forearm responsible for flexion of the wrist and fingers, as well as the thenar muscles in the hand. It does not innervate the extensor muscles, so injury to the median nerve does not affect MCP joint extension. (B) Ulnar nerve The ulnar nerve innervates many intrinsic hand muscles, such as the interossei and lumbricals (third and fourth), which assist in fine finger movements like flexion at the MCP joints and extension at the interphalangeal joints. However, it does not innervate the extensor digitorum or other extensors of the MCP joints, so injury to the ulnar nerve does not result in a loss of MCP extension. (C) Anterior interosseous nerve The anterior interosseous nerve is a motor branch of the median nerve that innervates specific flexor muscles, including the flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus (lateral part), and pronator quadratus. It has no role in extension of the MCP joints, so injury to this nerve does not result in loss of MCP extension.",

This action requires: Opposition of the thumb \u2013 controlled by the median nerve through its innervation of the thenar muscles (mainly the opponens pollicis).

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Median nerve Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) occurs due to compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passage in the wrist formed by the carpal bones and the transverse carpal ligament (flexor retinaculum). The median nerve innervates the thenar muscles and provides sensory innervation to the palmar side of the thumb, index, middle, and lateral half of the ring finger. Compression leads to symptoms such as pain, tingling, and numbness in these areas, as well as weakness of thumb opposition. This makes the median nerve the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: (A) Ulnar nerve The ulnar nerve does not pass through the carpal tunnel. Instead, it passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum in Guyon's canal. Compression of the ulnar nerve leads to ulnar nerve entrapment, which presents with sensory and motor deficits in the medial hand, not the classic symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ulnar nerve The ulnar nerve is often referred to as the \"musician\u2019s nerve\" because it provides motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, including the interossei and lumbricals (medial two) as well as the adductor pollicis and hypothenar muscles. These muscles are critical for the fine, intricate movements of the fingers required to play musical instruments. The ulnar nerve also plays a major role in finger adduction and abduction (via the interossei) and precision grip, making it essential for musicians. Injury to the ulnar nerve can lead to significant impairment of these fine motor functions. Incorrect Responses: (B) Radial nerve The radial nerve innervates the extensor muscles of the arm, forearm, and wrist. While it is critical for movements such as wrist and finger extension (e.g., lifting the hand), it is not primarily responsible for the intricate hand movements that are crucial for playing musical instruments, making it unrelated to the term \"musician\u2019s nerve.\" (C) Median nerve The median nerve supplies many forearm flexor muscles and the thenar muscles, which are responsible for thumb opposition and precision grip. While important for hand function, it is less involved in the fine motor control of the fingers provided by the intrinsic muscles of the hand, which are primarily controlled by the ulnar nerve. (D) Axillary nerve The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles, which are responsible for shoulder movements such as abduction and rotation. It has no role in the fine motor control of the hand, and thus it is not associated with the term \"musician\u2019s nerve.\"",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Median nerve The median nerve is often referred to as the \"labourer's nerve\" because it supplies the forearm flexor muscles (except the flexor carpi ulnaris and part of the flexor digitorum profundus) and the thenar muscles, which are essential for grip strength, wrist flexion, and fine manipulation of tools and objects. These functions are critical for labor-intensive tasks requiring repetitive hand and wrist movements, such as lifting, carrying, and handling tools. Furthermore, the median nerve is responsible for thumb opposition, which is vital for the power grip used in many manual tasks. Incorrect Responses: (B) Ulnar nerve While the ulnar nerve supplies many intrinsic muscles of the hand, which are involved in fine motor control, it is not primarily associated with the power grip or forearm flexor muscles. It is more involved in intricate hand movements and is often referred to as the \"musician\u2019s nerve,\" making it less relevant to heavy labor tasks. (C) Radial nerve The radial nerve innervates the extensor muscles of the arm and forearm, allowing for wrist and finger extension. While these functions are important for overall arm and hand movement, the radial nerve does not play a primary role in the flexor actions or the power grip required for labor-intensive work.

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) First lumbrical The first lumbrical is not supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Instead, it is innervated by the median nerve, which supplies the first and second lumbricals. These muscles are responsible for flexion of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and extension of the interphalangeal (IP) joints of the index and middle fingers. The median nerve\u2019s involvement in fine motor control of the lateral digits excludes the first lumbrical from ulnar nerve innervation. Incorrect Responses: (A) Adductor pollicis The adductor pollicis is supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. This muscle plays a key role in adducting the thumb, which is important for gripping and precision movements. Its innervation by the ulnar nerve highlights the nerve\u2019s significant role in controlling intrinsic hand muscles.

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Musculocutaneous nerve The musculocutaneous nerve is not directly related to the humerus. This nerve arises from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus (C5\u2013C7) and primarily supplies the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm (biceps brachii, brachialis, and coracobrachialis). It then continues as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm. The musculocutaneous nerve does not come into direct anatomical proximity with the humerus, unlike the other options listed. Incorrect Responses: (A) Radial nerve The radial nerve is closely related to the humerus. It passes through the spiral (radial) groove on the posterior surface of the humerus, making it vulnerable to injury in fractures of the shaft of the humerus. It supplies the posterior compartment muscles and provides sensory innervation to the posterior arm and forearm. (B) Axillary nerve The axillary nerve is also related to the humerus. It passes posteriorly through the quadrangular space, in close relation to the surgical neck of the humerus. This anatomical relationship makes the axillary nerve susceptible to injury in fractures or dislocations of the shoulder joint. It innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles. (C) Ulnar nerve The ulnar nerve has a significant anatomical relationship with the humerus. It passes behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus, in the cubital tunnel, where it is vulnerable to injury (commonly referred to as the \"funny bone\" sensation when struck). It provides motor and sensory innervation to parts of the hand and forearm.",

The ulnar nerve is responsible for motor control of the hypothenar muscles, facilitating actions like abduction, flexion, and opposition of the little finger. Incorrect Responses: (A) Radial nerve The radial nerve primarily innervates the muscles in the posterior compartment of the arm and forearm, which are responsible for extension at the elbow, wrist, and fingers. It does not supply any intrinsic muscles of the hand, including the hypothenar muscles. (B) Median nerve The median nerve innervates the muscles of the thenar eminence (responsible for thumb movements) and the first and second lumbricals.

It is innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve, which is often affected in carpal tunnel syndrome. When the median nerve is compressed, this muscle can become weak or paralyzed, leading to difficulties with thumb abduction and fine motor tasks such as pinching or grasping. Incorrect Responses: (B) Flexor pollicis longus paralysis The flexor pollicis longus is a deep muscle in the forearm that flexes the thumb. While it is supplied by the anterior interosseous nerve (a branch of the median nerve), this nerve does not pass through the carpal tunnel. Therefore, the flexor pollicis longus is not affected in carpal tunnel syndrome. (C) Flexor pollicis paralysis The term \"flexor pollicis\" is ambiguous, but if it refers to the flexor pollicis brevis, this muscle has a dual innervation. The superficial head is supplied by the median nerve, and the deep head is supplied by the ulnar nerve. Only the superficial head would be affected in carpal tunnel syndrome, and paralysis of the entire muscle would not occur. (D) Loss of sensation of thenar eminence The sensation of the thenar eminence is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve.

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Adduction at thumb The adductor pollicis is a key muscle responsible for bringing the thumb toward the palm in the plane of the palm (adduction). This muscle is innervated exclusively by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. An injury to the ulnar nerve at the wrist results in the loss of this function, causing the thumb to remain abducted due to the unopposed action of muscles innervated by the median nerve (e.g., abductor pollicis brevis). This condition is clinically significant and often observed as a weakness in pinching objects between the thumb and the fingers, such as holding a piece of paper (Froment's sign). Incorrect Responses: (A) Opposition of thumb Opposition of the thumb is primarily facilitated by the opponens pollicis muscle, which is innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve. The ulnar nerve does not supply this muscle, so its function remains unaffected in ulnar nerve injury at the wrist. (B) Abduction at the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb Abduction of the thumb is performed by the abductor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus. The abductor pollicis brevis is innervated by the median nerve, while the abductor pollicis longus is supplied by the posterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the radial nerve. These muscles are not affected by ulnar nerve injury. (D) Flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the middle finger Flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the middle finger is primarily performed by the lumbrical and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles. The lumbrical for the middle finger is innervated by the median nerve, while the flexor digitorum superficialis is innervated by the median nerve as well.

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Radial nerve The radial nerve supplies the extensor muscles of the forearm, including the extensor digitorum, which extends the MCP joints. When the radial nerve is paralyzed, these extensor muscles lose their function. As a result, the flexor muscles (supplied by the median and ulnar nerves) act unopposed, causing flexion at the MCP joints. This condition is commonly seen in radial nerve injuries such as those caused by fractures of the humeral shaft or prolonged compression of the nerve. Incorrect Responses: (A) Median nerve The median nerve innervates most of the flexor muscles in the forearm and some intrinsic hand muscles, including the thenar muscles. Median nerve paralysis affects flexion of the fingers and thumb opposition but does not cause persistent flexion of the MCP joints. (C) Ulnar nerve The ulnar nerve supplies most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand, including the interossei and lumbricals of the medial two fingers. Paralysis of the ulnar nerve results in a claw hand deformity, where the MCP joints are hyperextended, not flexed.

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Long thoracic nerve The long thoracic nerve is derived from the roots of the brachial plexus (C5, C6, and C7). It is purely motor and supplies the serratus anterior muscle. This muscle's function is crucial for scapular protraction and rotation, necessary for movements like pushing or raising the arm above the head. Since it lacks any sensory innervation, it is the correct answer to the question. Incorrect Responses: (A) Saphenous nerve The saphenous nerve is a purely sensory nerve that originates from the femoral nerve. It provides sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the leg and foot. (B) Sural nerve The sural nerve is also a sensory nerve that supplies the posterior and lateral parts of the lower leg and foot. It is formed by contributions from the tibial and common fibular nerves. (C) Intercostobrachial nerve The intercostobrachial nerve, a branch of the second intercostal nerve, is sensory in nature.

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Median The median nerve is the primary nerve passing through the carpal tunnel and is highly susceptible to compression when there is increased pressure within the tunnel, such as from a lunate dislocation. This results in symptoms including: Sensory loss: Numbness or tingling in the lateral three and a half fingers (thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger). Motor impairment: Weakness in the thenar muscles leading to difficulty with thumb opposition, abduction, and flexion. Incorrect Responses: (A) Median & Ulnar While the median nerve is affected in carpal tunnel syndromes caused by lunate dislocation, the ulnar nerve is not typically involved as it passes outside the carpal tunnel through Guyon\u2019s canal. Thus, only the median nerve is impacted. (C) Ulnar The ulnar nerve is unaffected in this case since it does not traverse the carpal tunnel. Compression of the ulnar nerve typically results in sensory and motor deficits in the medial one and a half fingers and the intrinsic hand muscles, which is not seen in lunate dislocation. (D) Radial The radial nerve is also not involved because it primarily innervates the posterior compartment of the forearm and does not pass through the carpal tunnel. Compression of the radial nerve would cause symptoms such as wrist drop, which are unrelated to lunate dislocation.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Adductor pollicis The adductor pollicis is located in the deep palm and plays a crucial role in bringing the thumb closer to the palm, facilitating pinching and gripping motions. It has two heads (transverse and oblique) and is exclusively supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Unlike the other thenar muscles, it does not receive innervation from the median nerve. Incorrect Responses: (A) Abductor pollicis brevis The abductor pollicis brevis is a muscle in the thenar eminence that is supplied by the recurrent branch of the median nerve. It is involved in the abduction of the thumb away from the hand, an action crucial for precision grip. (B) Opponens pollicis The opponens pollicis is also a muscle of the thenar eminence, supplied by the recurrent branch of the median nerve. This muscle facilitates opposition of the thumb, an essential motion for fine motor activities. (D) First lumbrical The first lumbrical is one of the intrinsic hand muscles responsible for flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joint and extension at the interphalangeal joints of the index finger.

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Adduction of the thumb Adduction of the thumb is mediated by the adductor pollicis, a deep muscle of the hand supplied by the ulnar nerve. Since the median nerve does not play a role in this action, a median nerve injury, even at the elbow, does not impact this function. This distinction highlights the specific roles of the ulnar and median nerves in hand movements. Incorrect Responses: (B) Flexion at DIP joints of 2nd finger Flexion at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint of the index finger is carried out by the flexor digitorum profundus, which is partially supplied by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve (for the lateral two fingers). An injury to the median nerve at the elbow would impair this action, particularly for the 2nd and 3rd digits. (C) Flexion of PIP of third finger The flexor digitorum superficialis, supplied by the median nerve, is responsible for flexion at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. Median nerve injury at the elbow would compromise this action in the 2nd and 3rd fingers. (D) Flexion at 1st and 2nd DIP fingers As mentioned earlier, flexion at the DIP joints of the index and middle fingers depends on the lateral portion of the flexor digitorum profundus, innervated by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve. This function is lost with a median nerve injury at the elbow.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Claw hand Claw hand is a hallmark of low ulnar nerve palsy. This deformity occurs because: The lumbricals to the 4th and 5th digits, which flex the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and extend the interphalangeal (IP) joints, are paralyzed. The unopposed action of the extensor digitorum leads to hyperextension at the MCP joints. Flexion at the proximal and distal IP joints occurs due to unopposed action of the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis. Thus, the characteristic \"clawing\" of the 4th and 5th digits is observed in low ulnar nerve palsy. Incorrect Responses: (B) Sensory loss of medial four digits While the ulnar nerve supplies sensation to the medial 1.5 digits (not four digits) and the associated palm, sensory loss is not the defining feature of low ulnar nerve palsy. Sensory involvement may be present but typically affects only the medial aspect of the hand. (C) Weakness of grips Weakness of grip strength can occur in ulnar nerve palsy due to the involvement of the interossei and lumbricals, which contribute to fine motor movements and grip. However, this is a secondary symptom and not as characteristic as claw hand. (D) Inability to extend at MCP joint The inability to extend at the MCP joint is not caused by low ulnar nerve palsy. In fact, hyperextension at the MCP joints due to unopposed action of extensor muscles is a characteristic feature of claw hand.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Median nerve. The thenar eminence, which is the fleshy area at the base of the thumb, is primarily innervated by the median nerve. This nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles responsible for thumb movements, such as the abductor pollicis brevis, flexor pollicis brevis, and opponens pollicis. These muscles are essential for thumb opposition, flexion, and abduction. The median nerve also contributes sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral palm and fingers. Incorrect Responses: B. Radial nerve: The radial nerve does not supply the thenar eminence. Instead, it innervates muscles primarily responsible for extending the wrist and fingers, as well as providing sensation to the back of the hand. It does not play a role in the movement or sensation of the thumb's thenar muscles. C. Anterior interosseous nerve: The anterior interosseous nerve is a branch of the median nerve and is involved in the innervation of deep flexor muscles of the forearm, like the flexor pollicis longus and the flexor digitorum profundus. It does not supply the muscles of the thenar eminence, which are innervated directly by the median nerve. D. Ulnar nerve: The ulnar nerve does not innervate the thenar muscles.

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Results in paralysis of anconeus muscle. The radial nerve, when injured in the spiral groove, typically causes a condition known as \"Saturday night palsy\" or radial nerve palsy. The anconeus muscle, which is a small muscle located near the elbow, is innervated by the radial nerve. Injury to the radial nerve in this region results in the paralysis of the anconeus muscle, which contributes to the loss of elbow extension. Incorrect Responses: A. Spares nerve supply to extensor carpi radialis longus: The extensor carpi radialis longus is actually innervated by the radial nerve before it passes through the spiral groove. As such, even in the case of an injury to the radial nerve in the spiral groove, the extensor carpi radialis longus is typically spared, as its motor supply comes from the radial nerve higher up in the arm. C. Leaves extension at elbow joint intact: Injury to the radial nerve in the spiral groove typically impairs extension at the elbow joint, as it affects the muscles responsible for extending the elbow, such as the triceps brachii and anconeus. While some function of the triceps may remain due to the fact that the nerve may be partially damaged, complete extension is often compromised. D. Weakness pronation movement: Pronation of the forearm is primarily controlled by the median nerve and the pronator teres muscle. While the radial nerve plays a role in forearm supination, it does not significantly contribute to pronation. Therefore, radial nerve injury would not cause weakness in pronation.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Radial Nerve. The radial nerve passes through the spiral groove (also known as the radial groove) of the humerus. This groove is located on the posterior surface of the humerus, and the radial nerve travels through it along with the profunda brachii artery. The radial nerve innervates the muscles of the posterior arm and forearm, including the triceps brachii and the extensors of the forearm. Damage to the radial nerve in this area can result in \"wrist drop\" due to impaired extension of the wrist and fingers. Incorrect Responses: B. Ulnar Nerve: The ulnar nerve does not pass through the spiral groove. It travels along the medial side of the arm, running behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus at the elbow, where it is often referred to as the \"funny bone.\" It does not pass through the spiral groove of the humerus. C. Musculocutaneous Nerve: The musculocutaneous nerve innervates the anterior compartment of the arm, including muscles like the biceps brachii. It does not pass through the spiral groove of the humerus. Instead, it pierces the coracobrachialis muscle and continues through the arm, providing motor innervation to the flexor muscles of the upper arm. D. Interosseous Nerve: The interosseous nerve refers to the anterior and posterior interosseous branches, which are derived from the median and radial nerves, respectively. These nerves provide innervation to the deep muscles of the forearm, but they do not pass through the spiral groove of the humerus. The posterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the radial nerve, travels along the posterior aspect of the forearm after the radial nerve exits the spiral groove.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cut to spinal part of accessory nerve. The spinal part of the accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) innervates the trapezius muscle, which is responsible for actions such as raising the arm above the head. Damage to this nerve, especially during an incision or drainage in the posterior triangle of the neck, can lead to weakness or paralysis of the trapezius muscle. This results in the inability to elevate the arm above the head, as the patient described, and is commonly known as \"shoulder drop\" due to weakened or paralyzed trapezius muscle function. Incorrect Responses: A. Damage to scalenus medius: The scalenus medius muscle is a muscle in the neck involved in the lateral flexion of the neck and helping to elevate the first rib during inspiration. Damage to this muscle would not result in the inability to raise the arm above the head. While the scalenus muscles are close to the structures in the posterior triangle, their function is not directly related to arm elevation. B. Injury to suprascapular nerve: The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which are part of the rotator cuff and involved in shoulder abduction and lateral rotation. While injury to this nerve can cause shoulder weakness or pain, it would not directly cause the inability to raise the arm above the head as seen with damage to the trapezius muscle (innervated by the accessory nerve). The suprascapular nerve injury would typically present with weakness in specific shoulder movements, not general arm elevation. D. Spread of infection to shoulder joint: Although an abscess in the neck may potentially spread to adjacent structures, it is less likely to immediately affect the shoulder joint directly unless the infection is severe and untreated for a prolonged period. The symptoms described in the case \u2014 difficulty raising the arm \u2014 are more consistent with nerve injury rather than the spread of infection to the shoulder joint.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Long thoracic nerve. Winging of the scapula occurs when there is injury to the long thoracic nerve, which innervates the serratus anterior muscle. The serratus anterior muscle plays a critical role in stabilizing the scapula against the rib cage and allowing proper shoulder movement. Damage to the long thoracic nerve causes weakness or paralysis of the serratus anterior, leading to the scapula protruding (winging) away from the thoracic wall, particularly when pushing against resistance or lifting the arm. Incorrect Responses: B. Short thoracic nerve: There is no \"short thoracic nerve.\" The term may be confused with other nerves, but it does not refer to a distinct nerve that could lead to winging of the scapula. The key nerve involved in scapular movement is the long thoracic nerve. C. Axillary nerve: The axillary nerve primarily innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles, which are responsible for shoulder abduction and lateral rotation. While injury to the axillary nerve can cause weakness or atrophy of these muscles, it does not lead to winging of the scapula. The scapula's stability is more related to the serratus anterior, which is controlled by the long thoracic nerve. D. Suprascapular nerve: The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which are part of the rotator cuff. Injury to this nerve results in weakness in shoulder abduction and external rotation, but it does not directly cause winging of the scapula. The main muscle responsible for scapular winging is the serratus anterior, controlled by the long thoracic nerve.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ulnar Nerve The ulnar nerve does not pass through the carpal tunnel. Instead, it passes through a different structure called Guyon's canal (or the ulnar canal), which is located at the wrist's medial aspect. Guyon's canal is formed by the pisiform bone and the hook of the hamate bone. This is where the ulnar nerve and artery travel to supply the intrinsic muscles of the hand and provide sensation to the little finger and half of the ring finger. Therefore, option (A) is correct because the ulnar nerve does not pass through the carpal tunnel. Incorrect Options: (B) Median Nerve The median nerve does pass through the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist formed by the carpal bones and the flexor retinaculum. The median nerve is one of the structures that pass through this tunnel, along with the flexor tendons. Compression of the median nerve in this tunnel is known as carpal tunnel syndrome, which causes symptoms like numbness and tingling in the hand, especially in the thumb, index, and middle fingers. (C) Flexor Digitorum Profundus The flexor digitorum profundus tendon also passes through the carpal tunnel. This muscle is responsible for flexing the distal phalanges of the fingers. The tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus, along with other flexor tendons, travels through the carpal tunnel to reach the fingers. (D) Flexor Digitorum Superficialis The flexor digitorum superficialis tendon also passes through the carpal tunnel. This muscle flexes the middle phalanges of the fingers and shares the carpal tunnel space with the other flexor tendons and the median nerve.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Levator palatini The cranial part of the accessory nerve (CN XI) primarily supplies the levator palatini muscle, which is involved in elevating the soft palate during swallowing and speaking. The cranial root of the accessory nerve joins the vagus nerve and carries motor fibers to muscles associated with the pharynx, larynx, and palate, including the levator palatini. This is the key function of the cranial part of the accessory nerve. Incorrect Options: (A) Sternocleidomastoid The sternocleidomastoid muscle is innervated by the spinal part of the accessory nerve, not the cranial part. The spinal portion of the accessory nerve provides motor innervation to the sternocleidomastoid, which is involved in head rotation and flexion. The cranial part does not innervate this muscle. (B) Trapezius The trapezius muscle is also innervated by the spinal part of the accessory nerve, not the cranial part. The trapezius is involved in moving and stabilizing the scapula, and its motor innervation comes from the spinal component of the accessory nerve. (C) Levator scapulae The levator scapulae muscle is not innervated by the cranial part of the accessory nerve.

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Deep branch of ulnar nerve The deep branch of the ulnar nerve is most likely damaged in this scenario. The ulnar nerve provides motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, including those responsible for the adduction and abduction of the fingers. Specifically, the lumbrical muscles and interossei muscles allow fine motor movements, such as holding a sheet of paper between the second and third digits (a test of key pinch). Injury to the deep branch of the ulnar nerve would impair these functions, leading to difficulty in holding a sheet of paper between these fingers, a sign of ulnar nerve palsy. Incorrect Options: (B) Deep branch of radial nerve The deep branch of the radial nerve primarily innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm and is not involved in the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Damage to the deep radial nerve could result in wrist drop and loss of extension of the fingers, but it would not cause difficulty in holding a sheet of paper between the second and third digits, which requires ulnar nerve function. (C) Superficial branch of ulnar nerve The superficial branch of the ulnar nerve provides sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the hand, including the little finger and half of the ring finger. It does not contribute to motor control of the hand\u2019s intrinsic muscles, so damage to this branch would not impair the ability to hold a sheet of paper between the fingers. (D) Median nerve The median nerve provides motor innervation to the thenar muscles and some of the muscles involved in flexion and opposition of the fingers, but it is not directly involved in the action of holding a sheet of paper between the second and third digits. This function is primarily controlled by the ulnar nerve, so damage to the median nerve would not typically cause this specific problem.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Axillary nerve The axillary nerve is the most commonly affected nerve in cases of anterior shoulder dislocation. The axillary nerve runs near the humeral head and passes through the quadrangular space, making it vulnerable when the humeral head is displaced anteriorly during a shoulder dislocation. Damage to the axillary nerve can result in sensory loss over the deltoid region and weakness in the deltoid and teres minor muscles, impairing shoulder abduction and external rotation. Incorrect Options: (A) Musculocutaneous nerve The musculocutaneous nerve is not typically affected in anterior shoulder dislocations. It arises from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus and supplies the flexor muscles of the arm, such as the biceps brachii. While injury to this nerve is possible in trauma, it is not as commonly affected in anterior shoulder dislocations as the axillary nerve. (B) Radial nerve The radial nerve is primarily located in the posterior compartment of the arm and travels along the spiral groove of the humerus. Although the radial nerve can be injured in humeral fractures, it is less commonly affected in anterior shoulder dislocations, which predominantly impact the axillary nerve due to its proximity to the shoulder joint. (D) Median nerve The median nerve originates from the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus and passes down the arm to the hand. It is not typically involved in anterior shoulder dislocations, as its path is more distal compared to the axillary nerve. The median nerve is more commonly injured in conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome or by trauma to the forearm.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Median nerve Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by the compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway in the wrist. The carpal tunnel is formed by the carpal bones and the transverse carpal ligament. The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the thumb, index, middle fingers, and half of the ring finger, as well as motor innervation to some of the muscles of the hand responsible for fine movements. Compression of this nerve leads to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the affected areas. This condition is often associated with repetitive wrist movements, prolonged use of vibrating tools, or underlying conditions like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Incorrect Options: (B) Medial cord of brachial plexus The medial cord of the brachial plexus is located in the upper arm and gives rise to nerves like the ulnar and medial pectoral nerves. Compression or injury to the medial cord can lead to symptoms in the regions supplied by its branches, but it is not related to carpal tunnel syndrome, which is specific to the wrist and hand. (C) Radial nerve The radial nerve innervates the posterior aspect of the arm and forearm, controlling extension of the wrist and fingers. It does not pass through the carpal tunnel and is therefore not involved in carpal tunnel syndrome. Radial nerve injuries typically cause symptoms such as wrist drop and sensory deficits in the back of the hand, distinct from the presentation of CTS. (D) Ulnar nerve The ulnar nerve passes through a different anatomical region called Guyon\u2019s canal at the wrist. It provides sensation to the little finger and half of the ring finger and controls specific hand muscles. Compression of the ulnar nerve causes ulnar nerve entrapment rather than carpal tunnel syndrome.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Median nerve. Pronator teres syndrome is a condition caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the two heads of the pronator teres muscle in the forearm. This results in pain, numbness, and tingling in the areas supplied by the median nerve, such as the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger. It may also cause weakness in the muscles innervated by the median nerve distal to the site of compression, such as the flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus (lateral half), and pronator quadratus. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Radial nerve Incorrect The radial nerve does not pass through or near the pronator teres muscle. Instead, it supplies muscles in the posterior compartment of the arm and forearm, and its compression causes symptoms in the extensor muscles and dorsum of the hand. Therefore, this option is incorrect. C. Ulnar nerve Incorrect The ulnar nerve does not pass near the pronator teres muscle. It travels along the medial side of the forearm and through the Guyon\u2019s canal at the wrist. Ulnar nerve compression results in symptoms in the ulnar side of the hand, not in areas innervated by the median nerve. Thus, this option is incorrect. D. Axillary nerve Incorrect The axillary nerve is restricted to the shoulder region, supplying the deltoid and teres minor muscles. It has no involvement with the pronator teres muscle or the median nerve, making this option incorrect.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Adduction. In an ulnar nerve injury, the adductor pollicis muscle, which is responsible for thumb adduction, is paralyzed. This muscle is exclusively innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. As a result, the thumb loses the ability to move medially toward the palm or index finger, which is the motion of adduction. This deficit can lead to a characteristic hand deformity, such as a weakened grip, as thumb adduction is crucial for powerful grasping movements. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Opposition Incorrect Opposition of the thumb involves bringing the thumb to touch the tips of the other fingers and is primarily mediated by the opponens pollicis, which is innervated by the median nerve. Since the ulnar nerve does not supply this muscle, opposition remains intact in ulnar nerve injury, making this option incorrect. B. Extension Incorrect Extension of the thumb is controlled by the extensor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis, which are innervated by the radial nerve. These muscles are not affected by an ulnar nerve injury, so thumb extension remains unaffected, making this option incorrect. D. Abduction Incorrect Abduction of the thumb is controlled by the abductor pollicis longus (radial nerve) and the abductor pollicis brevis (median nerve). Since neither of these muscles is innervated by the ulnar nerve, abduction is preserved in ulnar nerve injury,",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus (ECRL). When the radial nerve is injured just below the spiral groove, it spares the branches that innervate the triceps muscle (all three heads: lateral, medial, and long) because these branches arise proximally, above the spiral groove. However, the radial nerve continues to supply muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm, including the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), via its motor branches. Damage to the radial nerve at this level results in paralysis or weakness of the ECRL and other extensors of the wrist and fingers. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Lateral head of triceps Incorrect The lateral head of the triceps is supplied by the radial nerve, but its innervation arises above the spiral groove, meaning it remains unaffected by a nerve injury just below the groove. Therefore, this muscle is not paralyzed in this scenario. B. Medial head of triceps Incorrect The medial head of the triceps is also innervated by the radial nerve through a branch originating above the spiral groove, which means this muscle is spared in an injury below the groove. Thus, it is not paralyzed. C. Long head of triceps Incorrect The long head of the triceps, like the other heads, receives its innervation from a radial nerve branch that arises proximal to the spiral groove. Hence, the long head of the triceps is not affected by a radial nerve injury below the spiral groove.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Posterior interosseous nerve. The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) is a branch of the radial nerve that innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm, specifically those responsible for extending the fingers. An injury to the PIN can result in an inability to extend the fingers (a condition known as finger drop) while sparing wrist and elbow extension, as these functions are controlled by the radial nerve before it branches into the PIN. This explains why the patient can still extend the wrist and elbow but is unable to extend the fingers. Incorrect Responses: A. Radial nerve: The radial nerve supplies the extensor muscles of the arm and forearm, including the triceps (for elbow extension) and the wrist and finger extensors. While a radial nerve injury could cause an inability to extend the wrist and fingers, it would typically affect both wrist and finger extension. However, in this case, the wrist extension is preserved, making radial nerve injury less likely. B. Median nerve: The median nerve primarily supplies the flexor muscles of the forearm and intrinsic muscles of the hand. It does not play a role in the extension of the fingers. An injury to the median nerve would cause issues with finger flexion, especially in the thumb, index, and middle fingers, but would not specifically cause an inability to extend the fingers. C. Ulnar nerve: The ulnar nerve innervates some intrinsic hand muscles and the flexor carpi ulnaris in the forearm, but it does not control the extension of the fingers. An ulnar nerve injury would cause issues with finger abduction, adduction, and flexion (particularly in the little finger and ring finger), not finger extension. Thus, an ulnar nerve injury is not responsible for the inability to extend the fingers while wrist and elbow extension are intact.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Medial half by ulnar nerve. The flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) muscle is responsible for flexing the distal phalanges of the fingers. The nerve supply to the FDP is divided as follows: the medial half of the muscle, which controls the fourth and fifth fingers (ring and little fingers), is innervated by the ulnar nerve. The lateral half, which controls the second and third fingers (index and middle fingers), is innervated by the median nerve. This division reflects the complex innervation of the FDP, as it is innervated by two different nerves depending on the fingers they control. Incorrect Responses: B. Medial half by median nerve: This option is incorrect because the median nerve innervates the lateral half of the FDP (for the index and middle fingers), not the medial half. The medial half is actually innervated by the ulnar nerve, which supplies the ring and little fingers. C. Lateral half by ulnar nerve: This option is incorrect because the ulnar nerve innervates the medial half of the FDP (for the ring and little fingers), not the lateral half. The lateral half, responsible for the index and middle fingers, is innervated by the median nerve. D. Lateral half by radial nerve: This option is incorrect because the radial nerve does not innervate any part of the FDP. The radial nerve primarily supplies muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm (extensor muscles) and is not involved in the flexion of the fingers, which is controlled by the median and ulnar nerves.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) C6. The dermatome in the thumb region is supplied by the C6 spinal nerve. Dermatomes refer to areas of skin that are mainly supplied by the sensory fibers of a single spinal nerve. The C6 dermatome covers the lateral (thumb) side of the hand, including the thumb and part of the forearm. Therefore, the sensory innervation to the thumb comes from the C6 nerve root. Incorrect Responses: A. C5: The C5 dermatome primarily covers the lateral part of the shoulder and upper arm, not the thumb. While it does contribute to the overall sensory supply of the upper limb, it does not specifically supply the thumb. C7: The C7 dermatome is responsible for the middle part of the hand, including the index and middle fingers. It does not cover the thumb, which is innervated by the C6 dermatome. D. C8: The C8 dermatome primarily covers the medial aspect of the hand, including the little finger and part of the ring finger. It does not supply the thumb, which is under the sensory control of C6.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Posterior interosseous nerve. The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) is a branch of the radial nerve that innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm, responsible for extending the fingers. In this scenario, the patient has difficulty extending the fingers but is able to grip and hold a pen and has normal wrist extension. This suggests a problem with the motor function of the extensor muscles of the fingers, which is specifically controlled by the PIN. The absence of sensory disturbance further supports that the sensory branches of the radial nerve are unaffected, and only the motor aspect of extension is impaired, which is characteristic of a PIN injury. Incorrect Responses: A. C8, T1: An injury at the C8 and T1 levels of the spinal cord would typically affect the intrinsic muscles of the hand (like those responsible for fine motor control) and may lead to weakness in finger movements and potential sensory disturbances in the hand and forearm. However, the patient's ability to grip and hold a pen (which involves intrinsic hand muscles) and the absence of sensory disturbance suggest that the problem is more localized to the extensor muscles and not to the sensory or motor functions at the C8 and T1 levels. C. Lower part of brachial plexus: Injury to the lower part of the brachial plexus (C8, T1) could result in Klumpke\u2019s palsy, which typically presents with claw hand deformity, affecting both intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles. The patient's ability to make a grip and the absence of sensory disturbance do not align with this type of injury, making this an unlikely option. D. Hand area in motor cortex: A lesion in the motor cortex affecting the hand area could lead to weakness or paralysis in the entire hand (including both flexion and extension of fingers), but the patient's ability to grip and hold a pen indicates that the intrinsic muscles are functioning, which makes cortical involvement less likely. In addition, cortical lesions would typically present with more widespread symptoms and often have associated sensory disturbances, which the patient does not report.",

    "solution": "Correct Answer (D) FCU tendon. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway located on the palm side of the wrist. It contains structures essential for hand and finger movement, and specifically includes the median nerve and several tendons. However, the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon is not one of these. The FCU tendon runs along the ulnar side of the forearm and is located outside the carpal tunnel, passing through a separate compartment of the wrist. Incorrect Responses: A. Median nerve: The median nerve is one of the key contents of the carpal tunnel. It provides motor and sensory function to parts of the hand, particularly the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring fingers. Compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition characterized by pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand. B. FDS tendon: The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon is another structure that passes through the carpal tunnel. This tendon is responsible for flexing the middle phalanx of each finger, except the thumb. Its location within the tunnel is essential for proper finger movement. C. FPL tendon: The flexor pollicis longus (FPL) tendon is also found in the carpal tunnel. It is responsible for flexing the thumb. The FPL tendon runs through the tunnel alongside other tendons and the median nerve, enabling the thumb's proper movement. Each of these incorrect responses (median nerve, FDS tendon, and FPL tendon) are indeed components of the carpal tunnel, playing significant roles in hand and finger function. However, the FCU tendon is not part of the tunnel's contents, as it is found in a different anatomical region of the wrist.",
