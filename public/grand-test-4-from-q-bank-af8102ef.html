Once the gland is removed, the surgeon can ensure that there is no other hyperactive gland remaining by performing an intraoperative PTH assay for Miami criteria.</p>\n<p>It is based on the principle that the <strong>half-life</strong> of the PTH is<strong> 3-5 minutes</strong>. In a single-gland disease, once the gland is removed the PTH levels should drop to &gt;<strong>50% of the preoperative PTH level within 10 minutes</strong>. However, if there is no drop in PTH level, then a multi-gland disease is suspected and the surgery is converted to a <strong>bilateral neck exploration.</strong></p>",
