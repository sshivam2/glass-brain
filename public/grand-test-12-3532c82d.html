The likely cause of <strong>delayed anastomotic bleeding</strong> is the development of a <strong>mycotic aneurysm</strong> associated with <strong>Candida</strong> <strong>infection</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Delayed anastomotic hemorrhage </strong>may also manifest a <strong>few weeks or months later</strong> due to the formation of a mycotic aneurysm. The<strong> most frequently encountered </strong>causal <strong>organism</strong> is <em><strong>Candida albicans</strong></em> which is acquired from the donor. The prompt <strong>surgical intervention</strong> of a ruptured mycotic aneurysm necessitates an <strong>expeditious graft nephrectomy procedure.</strong></p>\n<p>The<strong> post-renal transplant</strong> can be complicated by the formation of a <strong>hematoma</strong> that has the potential to form within the transplant bed during the initial days following the surgical procedure. This phenomenon frequently occurs as a result of haemorrhaging from<strong> minute disconnected blood vessels</strong> in the renal hilum that were<strong> not discernible</strong> during the surgical procedure. In the present scenario, the patient exhibits hemodynamic stability, hence allowing for the utilization of<strong> CT angiography </strong>as a means of investigation. Following this, a<strong> subsequent re-exploration procedure can be conducted to facilitate the removal of the hematoma.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anastomotic haemorrhage</strong>, albeit infrequent, may also manifest as a potential complication. The observed condition manifests as haemorrhagic shock, characterized by a decrease in haemoglobin levels to<strong> less than 50 g/L</strong>. The current scenario poses a significant risk to the patient's life, necessitating an <strong>urgent return to the operating theatre</strong>. Repairing a defect in an arterial or venous anastomosis may be a potential course of action, although it is frequently necessary to resort to transplant nephrectomy.</p>\n<p>Other options\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cytomegalovirus</strong> is a common cause of<strong> graft dysfunction </strong>and <strong>not anastomotic haemorrhage</strong> in solid organ transplants <strong>between 1-6 months\u00a0</strong>post-transplant.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Nocardia</strong> is a common cause of <strong>graft dysfunction</strong> and <strong>not anastomotic haemorrhage</strong> in solid organ transplants <strong>more than 6 months post-transplant.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C<strong>:</strong>\u00a0<strong>BK virus</strong> is emerging as an important cause of <strong>graft dysfunction </strong>after renal transplantation. Infection with the BK virus is almost universal during childhood, with latent infection in the <strong>epithelium of the urinary tract.</strong> Immunosuppression causes lytic BK virus replication with graft involvement in 1\u20135% of renal transplants. Infection with the polyomavirus BK has been found in association with progressive nephropathy and ureteral obstruction <strong>more commonly 6 months post-transplant</strong>. Detection of BK viral DNA in blood and urine has been useful for diagnosis and monitoring response to therapy. BK virus-associated nephropathy is controlled by cidofovir, IV immunoglobulin.\u00a0The only effective treatment is to reduce the level of immunosuppression.\u00a0</p>",

It is the most commonly used drug in&nbsp;<strong>rescue analgesia</strong>&nbsp;due to its <strong>rapid pain control </strong>and <strong>less incidence of adverse effects.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rescue Analgesia</strong>&nbsp;involves the use of medications to minimize severe post-operative pain.&nbsp;Mild pain can be treated with oral analgesics but severe pain requires opioids like fentanyl.&nbsp;Fentanyl (20 to 25 &mu;g) is commonly used for this purpose to rapidly achieve analgesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fentanyl is a potent <strong>short-acting opioid analgesic</strong>. It is <strong>lipophilic</strong> in nature.</p>\n<p>Fentanyl is preferred over morphine or oxycodone in rescue analgesia. It <strong>controls</strong> the <strong>pain more rapidly</strong> than <strong>morphine</strong>&nbsp;(option A) and also <strong>reduces</strong> the incidence of <strong>PONV</strong> i.e postoperative nausea and vomiting. While <strong>oxycodone</strong> (option C) has good analgesic action when given systemically for visceral pain relief, it has an&nbsp;<strong>increased incidence of adverse effects </strong>when compared to <strong>fentanyl.</strong> Hence, <strong>fentanyl</strong>&nbsp;is preferred over morphine and oxycodone for rescue analgesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other uses are: to manage pain before surgical procedures, supplement in balanced anesthesia, in combination with benzodiazepines in diagnostic, endoscopic, angiographic, and minor procedures, and as an adjuvant in spinal anesthesia.</p>\n<p>Hypertonia can often occur following a rapid infusion of fentanyl and hence a muscle relaxant is often supplemented. <strong>Respiratory depression</strong> is a common side effect. Other side effects include nausea, vomiting, and itching.</p>\n<p>Note: <strong>Codeine</strong> is a less potent opioid agonist. Oral codeine is useful to suppress cough but has mild to moderate analgesic properties. When given intravenously, it can cause profound hypotension, and hence it is not recommended.</p>",

    "solution": "<p class=\"p1\">The mechanism of inhibition of antagonistic muscle is via reciprocal inhibition.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afferent fibers</strong> from muscle spindles are related to the <strong>spinal motor neuron</strong> complex that supplies the same muscle. When an impulse is generated, an excitatory potential is generated that leads to the action in the muscle. Meanwhile, an <strong>inhibitory potential</strong> is produced in the motor neurons supplying the <strong>antagonistic</strong> muscle group. By this mechanism, there is both an excitatory and an inhibitory impulse known as <strong>reciprocal inhibition.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option A: <strong>Lateral inhibition</strong>: Stimulation of one motor neuron inhibits adjacent motor neurons. This is known as lateral inhibition. Signals from the spinal motor neurons stimulate Renshaw cells, which are inhibitory interneurons. Renshaw cells transmit inhibitory signals to the adjacent motor neurons, by&nbsp;releasing the neurotransmitter <strong>glycine</strong>. This helps in sharpening signals in order to maintain the desired direction of signal transmission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C: <strong>Feedback inhibition</strong> <strong>(Recurrent inhibition)</strong>: Signals from neurons may inhibit themselves by negative feedback. This is known as feedback inhibition or recurrent inhibition. Signals from a neuron may stimulate the Renshaw cell, which in turn inhibits the same neuron.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D: <strong>Feedforward inhibition</strong>: Signals from neurons stimulate inhibitory cells. These inhibitory cells then <strong>inhibit a different group of neurons</strong>. This is called feedforward inhibition. For example, granule cells stimulate the inhibitory basket cells and stellate cells via parallel fibers. These basket and stellate cells then inhibit the Purkinje cells. This is known as feedforward inhibition.</p>",

The headache typically originates <strong>around the eye</strong> and the root or l<strong>ateral side of the nose </strong>and may extend to the maxillary region and affect the related teeth, zygoma, mastoidal area, occiput, and in some cases, even the shoulder and arm. Pain can manifest in either <strong>episodic</strong> form, characterized by intermittent bouts that endure for hours to days, or in a <strong>continuous</strong> manner. several proposed etiologies for sphenopalatine neuralgia (SN), including infection of the posterior ethmoid and sphenoidal sinus according to Sluder's theory, trauma (in which case the term \"Sluder's neuropathia\" is preferred), <strong>demyelination</strong>, or the existence of <strong>intranasal contact points</strong> such as a septal spine impinging on the middle turbinate.</p>",
