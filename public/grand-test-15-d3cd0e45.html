Verapamil</strong> is the <strong>best prophylactic</strong> treatment for cluster headaches to reduce the frequency and severity of cluster headaches.</p>\n<p>Cluster headache is characterized by severe, <strong>one-sided headaches</strong> that occur in clusters, often associated with <strong>autonomic symptoms,</strong> such as <strong>tearing, redness</strong> <strong>of the eye</strong>, <strong>runny nose</strong>\u00a0and <strong>unilateral headache</strong> that typically lasts between <strong>15 to 180 minutes. </strong>The important feature of this headache is <strong>periodicity.</strong> At least one of the daily attacks of pain recurs at the same hour each day. It is also associated with autonomic features, such as unilateral lacrimation and rhinorrhea. Occasionally features of Horner's syndrome may be seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The typical cluster headache patient has daily bouts of one to two attacks of relatively short-duration unilateral pain for <strong>8\u201310 weeks a yea</strong>r; this is usually followed by a <strong>pain-free interval </strong>that averages a little <strong>less than 1 year.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Verapamil,</strong> which is a <strong>calcium channel block </strong>is the drug of choice for the long term prophylaxis of cluster headaches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For aborting an acute attack of cluster headache, <strong>subcutaneous sumatriptan</strong> (6 mg), a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist, is most effective. <strong>High-flow oxygen</strong> is also effective in the management of an acute attack. <strong>100% oxygen </strong>at <strong>10\u201312 L/min</strong> for <strong>15\u201320 min</strong> is required as treatment. If injectable sumatriptan is unavailable, then high-flow oxygen is the next best treatment option (Option B).</p>\n<p>Other options:<br />Options C and D: <strong>Migraine</strong> presents as an <strong>episodic headache</strong> associated with <strong>nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity,</strong> and sensitivity to sound (phonophobia). Common triggers include bright lights, sounds, and hunger. The release of vasoactive peptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) by the trigeminal nucleus cells is the theory used to explain the pathogenesis of the condition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Avoidance of recognized triggers is helpful to avoid symptoms. The various drugs used to treat an acute attack of migraine are <strong>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> (NSAIDs), <strong>triptans,</strong> CGRP Receptor <strong>Antagonists</strong> (rimegepant), 5-HT1/F receptor agonists (lasmiditan), and dopamine receptor antagonists (domperidone).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The drugs used in the prophylaxis include propranolol, valproate, topiramate and flunarizine.</p>",

In a vesicovaginal fistula, the main complaint will be<strong> constant dribbling </strong>of urine <strong>(true incontinence). </strong>It usually follows <strong>difficult childbirth</strong>. A <strong>positive methylene blue</strong> <strong>test</strong> confirms the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Vesicovaginal fistulae occur <strong>mostly due to obstetric injuries</strong> such as <strong>prolonged labour, and instrumental or manipulative deliveries</strong>. Patients present with true incontinence characterized by <strong>constant dribbling of urine.</strong> The presence of urine in the undergarments is uncomfortable and leads to <strong>pruritus</strong> and <strong>excoriation </strong>of the genital area.</p>\n<p>Investigations to be performed include urine culture, ultrasound of the kidney, ureter, and bladder, intravenous pyelography and <strong>methylene blue 3 swab test.</strong></p>\n<p>In the methylene blue swab test, methylene blue is injected into the bladder via the catheter, and three sterile swabs are placed into the vaginal cavity. If the <strong>uppermost swab gets wet and not stained</strong> - the leak is from the ureter, seen in the <strong>ureterovaginal</strong> <strong>fistula</strong>. If the <strong>middle swab gets stained -</strong> the leak is from the bladder, seen in <strong>vesicovaginal fistula.</strong> If the <strong>lowermost swab gets stained </strong>- the leak is from the urethra, seen in the <strong>urethrovaginal fistula.\u00a0</strong></p>",

    "solution": "<p><strong>Sevoflurane</strong> is a volatile anaesthetic agent that is preferred for the <strong>induction</strong> of <strong>anaesthesia</strong> in <strong>children</strong> because it is <strong>less likely to cause airway irritation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Children have <strong>smaller</strong> <strong>airways</strong>, making them <strong>more susceptible to occlusion</strong> by secretions and swelling. As a result, even slight airway irritation can cause significant airway obstruction.</p>\n<p>The <strong>resistance</strong> to <strong>laminar</strong> <strong>airflow</strong> <strong>increases</strong> in inverse proportion to the <strong>fourth</strong> power of the <strong>radius</strong> (<strong>Poiseuille's law).</strong> Therefore, a small <strong>decrease in</strong> the <strong>radius</strong> of the airway results in a marked <strong>increase</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>resistance</strong> to airflow and the work of breathing. <strong>Children</strong> are more <strong>reliant on</strong> the <strong>diaphragm</strong> for inspiration, due to the <strong>relative</strong> <strong>immaturity</strong> of the <strong>intercostal</strong> muscles and <strong>accessory</strong> <strong>muscles</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Sevoflurane</strong> also has a <strong>faster</strong> <strong>onset</strong> of action than other volatile anaesthetic agents, such as halothane or isoflurane.

However, it is important to note that <strong>sevoflurane</strong> can also cause more <strong>rapid</strong> <strong>cardiovascular</strong> <strong>changes</strong>, such as <strong>tachycardia</strong> and hypotension, during induction.

All volatile anaesthetic agents can cause seizures, especially in high doses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Option C: Sevoflurane is <strong>slightly more likely </strong>to cause <strong>respiratory</strong> <strong>depression</strong> than other volatile anaesthetic agents, but this is not a major concern in most cases.</p>",
