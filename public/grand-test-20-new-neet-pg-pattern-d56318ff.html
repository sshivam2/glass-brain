PRPP is then converted to <strong>5-phosphoribosylamine</strong> by the enzyme <strong>PRPP glutamyl amidotransferase</strong>, in the presence of <strong>glutamine</strong> and H<sub>2</sub>O; this undergoes a series of changes to form <strong>inosine monophosphate</strong> (IMP).</p>\n<p>The IMP formed can then be used for the <strong>synthesis </strong>of both <strong>AMP</strong> and <strong>GMP</strong> by different pathways.

The prevalence increases with <strong>age</strong>, <strong>diabetes,</strong> and for patients with other vascular conditions such as <strong>coronary artery disease,</strong> <strong>peripheral aortic</strong>(as evidenced by aortic bruits), or <strong>lower extremity disease</strong>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Critical levels of stenosis lead to a <strong>reduction in perfusion pressure</strong> that <strong>activates the renin-angiotensin system</strong>, reduces sodium excretion, and activates sympathetic adrenergic pathways. These events lead to systemic hypertension and accelerated target organ injury, including left ventricular hypertrophy and <strong>renal fibrosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Severe or <strong>refractory hypertension</strong>, <strong>carotid</strong> or femoral artery <strong>bruits</strong>, <strong>flash pulmonary edema</strong>, unexplained deterioration of renal function or <strong>deterioration of renal function associated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</strong> (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker(ARB) should raise the possibility of renovascular hypertension. These agents decrease the glomerular filtration rate in a stenotic kidney owing to efferent renal arteriolar dilation, particularly in bilateral renal artery stenosis.\u00a0Approximately 50% of patients with renovascular hypertension have an <strong>abdominal or flank bruit</strong>, due to the stenosed renal arteries.</p>\n<p>If renal artery stenosis is suspected imaging studies should be the <strong>next step</strong> in the evaluation. <strong>Doppler ultrasound</strong> of the renal arteries produces reliable estimates of renal blood flow and offers the opportunity to track a lesion over time. <strong>Contrast arteriography</strong> remains the <strong>gold standard</strong>\u00a0for the evaluation and identification of renal artery lesions. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Medical therapy</strong> should include the use of <strong>ACE inhibitors</strong> or <strong>ARBs</strong>, attainment of goal BPs, cessation of tobacco, statins, and aspirin.

Primary hyperaldosteronism can be familial or sporadic, caused by an <strong>aldosterone-producing adenoma</strong> or <strong>bilateral adrenal hyperplasia</strong>. The age at the time of diagnosis is generally the third through fifth decade. In patients with primary aldosteronism, <strong>increased aldosterone production</strong> is <strong>independent of the renin-angiotensin system</strong>, and the consequences are <strong>sodium retention</strong>, <strong>hypertension</strong> and <strong>hypokalemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Estimation of 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion</strong> is used as a screening test for <strong>Cushing's syndrome</strong>, which is one of the causes of <strong>secondary hypertension</strong>.

The acidic contents of the stomach play a major role in absorption. Once it reaches the brush border of the absorbing cell, the ferric form is converted to ferrous form by\u00a0<strong>ferrireductase</strong>. This ferrous form is then transported into the cell by\u00a0<strong>divalent metal transporter type 1 (DMT-1).\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Once inside the\u00a0cell, iron may be\u00a0<strong>stored</strong>\u00a0as\u00a0<strong>ferritin</strong>\u00a0or transported\u00a0to plasma through\u00a0<strong>ferroportin</strong>. During the transport, iron is converted back into the ferric form by\u00a0<strong>hephaestin</strong> and <strong>ceruloplasmin.\u00a0</strong>The iron in plasma is then\u00a0<strong>transferred</strong>\u00a0to the required tissues with the help of protein\u00a0<strong>transferrin.\u00a0</strong>Iron is a major content of<strong>\u00a0hemoglobin,\u00a0</strong>myoglobin, cytochrome P-450 group of enzymes, components of electron transport chain, and ribonucleotide reductase.</p>\n<p><strong>Hepcidin</strong>, a protein secreted from the liver plays a major role in the regulation of iron absorption. When the body\u2019s iron stores are adequate, it downregulates the expression of ferroportin and thereby decreases iron absorption.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The following illustration shows the absorption of iron in the duodenum:\u00a0</p>",
