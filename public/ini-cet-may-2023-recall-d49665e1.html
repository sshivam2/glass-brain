This causes&nbsp;phosphorylation of signal transducer and activation of <strong>transcription (STAT) proteins</strong>, which results in the transcription of target genes and the synthesis of proteins.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 873\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Phosphorylation of JAK2 also results in the activation of&nbsp;other intracellular enzyme pathways such as <strong>mitogen-activated protein kinases</strong> (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 874\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Hormones such as <strong>adrenal</strong> (<strong>Aldosterone</strong>)and gonadal steroid hormones, <strong>thyroid</strong> hormones, retinoid hormones, and vitamin D, bind with protein receptors inside the cell rather than on the cell surface.

The presence of ketosis can be established by the detection of ketone bodies in urine by<strong>\u00a0Rothera's test</strong>.</p>\n<p>The test involves the saturation of 5 mL of urine with solid <strong>ammonium sulfate</strong>. This is followed by the addition of a few drops of freshly prepared <strong>sodium nitroprusside</strong> followed by 2 mL of <strong>liquor ammonia</strong> along the sides of the test tube. The development of a <strong>purple ring</strong> indicates the presence of ketone bodies in urine. Strip tests based on the same principle are also available.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option A:\u00a0<strong>Seliwanoff's test</strong>\u00a0will\u00a0<strong>distinguish glucose</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>fructose</strong>. The reagent is resorcinol in HCl. 3 ml of the reagent and 0.5 ml of urine are heated for 30 seconds up to a boiling point. A red color indicates the presence of fructose.</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Benedict's test</strong>\u00a0is a test commonly used in the follow-up of diabetics for the detection of\u00a0<strong>glucose</strong>\u00a0in urine (glucosuria). It uses Benedict's reagent containing sodium carbonate, copper sulfate, and sodium citrate.\u00a0<strong>Reducing sugars\u00a0</strong>(containing a free aldehyde/ keto group) will reduce Benedict's reagent. Examples include glucose, fructose, and lactose.\u00a0The test is a semi-quantitative test. The blue color indicates no reducing sugar.\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 333\">Option C:\u00a0<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fouchet's test</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0is used for detecting the presence of\u00a0<strong>b</strong></span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ile pigments in urine.\u00a0</span></strong>Here, urine is heated with barium sulfate, which adsorbs bilirubin.

Agitation helps to maintain a uniform distribution of platelets, prevent their clumping together, and facilitate gas exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>Fresh frozen plasma</strong> and <strong>cryoprecipitate</strong> are generally stored at a temperature of&nbsp;<strong>&ndash;30 &deg;C</strong>. They are<strong> thawed</strong> at temperatures between <strong>+30 &deg;C and +37 &deg;C</strong> in the blood bank before issue and transported to the ward at ambient temperature. They must be used immediately and should never be refrozen.</p>\n<p>Whole blood and <strong>packed red cells</strong> are always stored at <strong>+2 &deg;C to +6 &deg;C</strong> and transported between +2 &deg;C and +10 &deg;C. Packed red cells stored with&nbsp;<strong>SAGM</strong> (sodium, adenine, glucose, and mannitol as components) provide a shelf-life of up to&nbsp;<strong>42 days.</strong></p>",

Each such episode should last for<strong> at least 10 seconds</strong>, resulting in&nbsp;&ge;3% drop in oxygen saturation or a brain cortical arousal. OSA is diagnosed by <strong>overnight polysomnogram (PSG)</strong>.

They can present with <strong>Cheyne-Stokes breathing</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Narcolepsy</strong> (option D) presents with difficulty sustaining wakefulness and disturbed nocturnal sleep. However, unlike sleep apnea, patients with narcolepsy usually feel well-rested on awakening and then feel tired throughout the day.

    "solution": "<p>In the above clinical scenario, the most likely cause of itching around the vulvovaginal area is&nbsp;<strong>canagliflozin</strong>. The&nbsp;side effects associated with canagliflozin are <strong>urinary tract infections</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>genital mycotic infections</strong> due to the high glucose content of the urine,&nbsp;<strong>increased risk of fractures</strong>, and <strong>lower extremity amputations</strong>.</p>\n<p>Canagliflozin is a <strong>sodium-glucose transporter 2</strong> (SGLT-2) <strong>inhibitor</strong>. Other SGLT-2 inhibitors include dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. They act by&nbsp;inhibiting the&nbsp;SGLT-2 transporter which is present on the <strong>proximal</strong> segment of the <strong>renal tubule</strong>. It is responsible for the reabsorption of 80-90% of filtered glucose.&nbsp;It&nbsp;inhibits glucose reabsorption resulting in glycosuria and a change in the renal threshold.</p>\n<p>SGLT2 inhibitors can cause <strong>mild weight loss</strong> and reduction in blood pressure. Drugs like&nbsp;empagliflozin and canagliflozin are found to <strong>reduce</strong> major <strong>cardiovascular events</strong>.</p>\n<p>The common side effects include <strong>urinary tract infections</strong> and<strong> genital mycotic infections</strong> due to the high glucose content of the urine.&nbsp;There is a risk of the development of <strong>diabetic ketoacidosis</strong>. It increases the <strong>risk of fractures</strong> and <strong>lower limb amputations</strong> due to the creation of an imbalance with the minerals and circulating parathormone and vitamin D. Since SGLT2 inhibitors depend on the rate of glucose filtration to be effective, potency decreases if given in stage 3 kidney disease (GFR 60&ndash;30 mL/min).</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Acarbose is an a</strong><strong>lpha-glucosidase inhibitor. </strong>It&nbsp;reduces the intestinal absorption of glucose by inhibiting the intestinal brush border enzyme, alpha-glucosidase. These drugs also increase GLP-1 levels in circulation. They&nbsp;<strong>reduce post-prandial glucose</strong>&nbsp;levels.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Linagliptin</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>dipeptidyl-peptidase-4&nbsp;</strong>(DPP-4)<strong>&nbsp;inhibitor</strong>. It is used in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination therapy when metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated. It&nbsp;binds extensively to plasma proteins and is cleared<strong>&nbsp;primarily by the hepatobiliary system.&nbsp;</strong>Hence, no dosage adjustment is needed in renal failure.&nbsp;<strong>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors&nbsp;</strong>enhance the release of insulin postprandially, decrease glucagon, and thereby lower mealtime as well as fasting glucose. They are weight neutral.</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Liraglutide</strong>&nbsp;is also a&nbsp;<strong>GLP-1 receptor agonist</strong>&nbsp;and is given only in the&nbsp;<strong>subcutaneous injectable</strong>&nbsp;form. It was recently approved in the treatment of&nbsp;<strong>obesity.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

At puberty, testosterone is responsible for<strong> aggressive psychosexual behavior, deepening of the voice, increased muscle mass, and initiating spermatogenesis.</strong></p>\n<p>In 5 alpha reductase deficiency, there is a failure of conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. As <strong>testosterone levels are normal </strong>there is a normal development of Wolffian ducts and thus<strong> male internal genitalia are normal</strong>. However, some cases may have a <strong>blind-ending vagina.</strong></p>\n<p>As levels of DHT are low the child will have a <strong>female-looking external genitalia </strong>at <strong>birth</strong>. These children tend to be raised as females till <strong>puberty</strong>, by which they start exhibiting <strong>virilization&nbsp;</strong>which is caused by <strong>testosterone</strong>. Hence <strong>clitoromegaly</strong> is seen. There is a <strong>lack of breast development</strong> as testosterone is not converted to estrogen. <strong>Pubic hair is scanty</strong> as its development depends on both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.</p>\n<p>Investigations reveal an<strong> increase in the ratio of testosterone to DHT</strong> after hCG administration.</p>\n<p>If the child<strong> wants to be raised as a female</strong>, then the <strong>testes </strong>have to be <strong>removed</strong> before the <strong>child attains puberty and virilization of the child.</strong> <strong>Estrogen therapy</strong> that is appropriate for inducing and maintaining feminization should be started at the time of usual pubertal maturation or immediately after gonadectomy is performed in an adult.<strong> </strong>Surgical correction in the form of <strong>vaginoplasty</strong> is performed<strong>. </strong>If the <strong>child is raised as a male</strong> corrective procedure include<strong> hypospadias correction, correction of chordee, and reconstruction of the urethra.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p><strong>Option B</strong>: 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency results in <strong>decreased production of testosterone by </strong>adrenal glands. However, there will be normal testosterone production from the testes. Hence depending on the <strong>testosterone and dihydrotestosterone </strong>levels the child may have<strong> female-looking external genitalia or ambiguous genitalia at birth</strong>. 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency also results in a <strong>decrease in 17-OH progesterone levels and cortisol levels</strong>. Hence there is an <strong>increase in ACTH</strong> due to the loss of negative feedback which increases<strong>&nbsp;aldosterone</strong>. Due to an increase in aldosterone, the child will have <strong>hypertension and hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option C</strong>: Androgen insensitivity syndrome is an <strong>X-linked recessive</strong>&nbsp;disorder in which the&nbsp;<strong>androgen receptors</strong> are absent, scanty, or fail to respond to testosterone. Hence there will be <strong>no signs of virilization</strong>. The <strong>serum testosterone levels </strong>will be <strong>elevated</strong>. There will be <strong>normal breast development </strong>as testosterone is converted to estrogen.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D</strong>: Swyer syndrome results from a <strong>mutation in the SRY gene on the Y chromosome</strong>. This results in dysgenetic gonads. There is <strong>no production of AMH and testosterone</strong> and hence there is development of<strong>&nbsp;female internal and external genitalia</strong>. There will be<strong> no signs of virilization.</strong></p>",
