After the target RNA is transcribed from its gene (post-transcriptional), the miRNA may either induce mRNA cleavage or repress its translation. This is referred to as <strong>gene silencing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RNA interference(RNAi)</strong> is a biological process in which miRNA/siRNA molecules inhibit gene expression by neutralizing targeted mRNAs.The\u00a0microRNA\u00a0(miRNA) belongs to a group of\u00a0non-coding genes.\u00a0The miRNA genes are transcribed but not translated into proteins. They play a role in the regulation of the expression of the target gene by\u00a0post-transcriptional\u00a0silencing.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The\u00a0<strong>miRNA</strong>\u00a0<strong>gene</strong>\u00a0present in the nucleus is transcribed to\u00a0<strong>primary</strong>\u00a0<strong>miRNA</strong>, which is further converted to\u00a0<strong>pre-miRNA</strong>\u00a0by an enzyme<strong>\u00a0DROSHA\u00a0</strong>intranuclearly and exported to the cytoplasm by an export protein.</li>\n<li>The pre-miRNA undergoes trimming, by an enzyme called\u00a0<strong>DICER</strong>, into\u00a0<strong>mature</strong>\u00a0<strong>single-stranded</strong>\u00a0<strong>miRNA</strong>.</li>\n<li>The mature miRNA is associated with a multiprotein aggregate called\u00a0<strong>RNA-induced silencing complex</strong>\u00a0(<strong>RISC</strong>).</li>\n<li>The target mRNAs contain seed sequences in their\u00a0<strong>3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR)\u00a0</strong>that determines the specificity of miRNA binding and gene silencing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the base pairing between the miRNA strand and its target mRNA, the RISC causes gene silencing either by\u00a0<strong>mRNA</strong>\u00a0<strong>cleavage</strong>\u00a0or by\u00a0<strong>repressing its translation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>siRNA is similar in function to miRNA and is used in RNA interference.</strong></p>",

It is caused by the deficiency of <strong>muscle glycogen phosphorylase</strong>.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>McArdle disease, also known as\u00a0<strong>type V</strong>\u00a0glycogen storage disorder, is an\u00a0<strong>autosomal recessive</strong>\u00a0condition. It typically presents during<strong>\u00a0late childhood</strong>\u00a0or in the <strong>second decade</strong> of life. The\u00a0muscle glycogen phosphorylase enzyme deficiency interferes with ATP generation by glycogenolysis in the muscles. This causes <strong>muscle</strong>\u00a0<strong>glycogen accumulation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Symptoms are\u00a0<strong>exercise intolerance</strong>\u00a0associated with\u00a0<strong>muscle cramps</strong>.\u00a0Due to high-intensity exercise, sudden persistent muscle contraction occurs.

During inspiration, blood flows into the right ventricle.

The affected leg is then passively and slowly raised by the ankle with the knee fully extended. The examiner stops further leg elevation when pain is elicited. Normally it should be possible to raise the limb to 80&ndash;90 degrees. The SLRT test is positive if the patient develops pain when the leg is between 30 and 60/70 degrees from horizontal. The pain should be radicular type and radiating to the back of the thigh or to the calf.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>2. Bragard test&nbsp;(or Sciatic stretch test or Flip test)</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Perform SLRT. At the point where the patient experiences discomfort, the leg is lowered a little. The stretching and pain become less. At this angle, the <strong>ankle is passively dorsiflexed</strong>. If the pain at the back of the thigh or in the calf is felt again, the test is positive. This is also called reinforcement positive or Bragard&rsquo;s sign positive.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>3. Crossed SLRT (</strong>or<strong> well-leg raising test </strong>or<strong> Fajersztajn sign)</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">When SLRT is performed on the unaffected side, the patient may feel pain on the affected side.

It becomes positive usually when there is severe compression due to a centrally located prolapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>4. Bowstring sign</strong> (or <strong>popliteal compression test</strong>)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The &lsquo;bowstring sign&rsquo; is even more specific for disc prolapse than SLRT. Perform SLRT until the patient experiences sciatic pain. Without reducing the amount of lift, bend the knee so as to relax the sciatic nerve <strong>(Buckling sign)</strong>. Buttock pain is immediately relieved.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>The examiner then presses the popliteal fossa to stretch the lateral popliteal nerve behind the lateral tibial condyle. This will tighten the nerve like a bowstring and re-induce the pain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>5.

It is incorporated into DNA, where it produces DNA strand breaks and depletion of NAD and ATP, leading to apoptosis. Also, it is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase. It does not require cell division to be cytotoxic.</p>\n<p>Cladribine is administered daily for seven days by continuous intravenous infusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Cladribine</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>deoxycoformycin</strong> are highly active agents and cause durable remissions in patients.\u00a0It is excreted by the kidneys, and doses should be adjusted<br />for renal dysfunction.</p>\n<p>Cladribine is also used in\u00a0CLL, low-grade lymphomas, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (like mycosis fungoides and the S\u00e9zary syndrome), and Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia.</p>\n<p>The major side effect is immunosuppression. Nausea, infections, thrombocytopenia, high fever, headache, fatigue, skin rashes, and tumor lysis syndrome can also occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Interferon-alpha</strong>\u00a0is also used but not as effective as nucleoside analogues.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Splenectomy</strong>\u00a0is often associated with prolonged remissions.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy-refractory patients are treated with\u00a0<strong>vemurafenib</strong>, a BRAF kinase inhibitor.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Vinblastin</strong> is an <strong>M</strong> <strong>phase</strong>-specific anti-cancer drug. Vinca alkaloids bind \u03b2-tubulin and inhibit its polymerisation into microtubules \u2192, preventing mitotic spindle formation.</p>\n<p><strong>Topotecan</strong> is <strong>S phase</strong> specific anticancer drug. It inhibits topoisomerase one and prevents DNA unwinding and replication.</p>\n<p><strong>Cisplatin</strong> is a cell cycle-independent anti-cancer drug. Its mode of action has been linked to its ability to <strong>crosslink</strong> with the purine bases on the DNA, interfering with DNA repair mechanisms, causing DNA damage, and subsequently inducing <strong>apoptosis in cancer cells.</strong></p>\n<p>It is used in the treatment of <strong>testicular, bladder, ovary, and lung </strong>carcinomas<strong>.</strong> However, because of drug resistance and numerous undesirable side effects, such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Severe kidney injury,</li>\n<li>Allergic reactions,</li>\n<li>Decrease immunity to infections,</li>\n<li>Gastrointestinal disorders,</li>\n<li>Hemorrhage, and</li>\n<li>Hearing loss, especially in younger patients,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other platinum-containing anti-cancer drugs, such as carboplatin oxaliplatin, have been used.</p>\n<p>Methotrexate is an antimetabolite.\u00a0It is a <strong>folic acid analogue</strong> that <strong>inhibits</strong> the enzyme <strong>dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)</strong>.\u00a0Methotrexate and its polyglutamate<strong> also inhibit</strong> the enzymes involved in the<strong> denovo purine and thymidylate synthesis.</strong></p>",
