It is <strong>bioactivated by the CYP2C19</strong> enzyme. If there is downregulation of this enzyme it will cause a decrease in the efficacy of clopidogrel and can lead to thrombotic events like stroke. Drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 can also decrease the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. <strong>Proton-pump inhibitors</strong> may cause <strong>inhibition of CYP2C19</strong> and when they are given in combination there would be a decrease in the efficacy of clopidogrel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Therapeutic uses</strong>: Clopidogrel is used to reduce the rate of stroke and myocardial infarction. It also decreases the rate of deaths in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke. Other uses are acute coronary syndrome and peripheral arterial disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Adverse effects</strong>: Increased <strong>risk of bleeding</strong> especially when given with an anticoagulant or aspirin. Rarely thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can occur.</p>\n<p><strong>CYP2C19</strong>: Common drugs that are metabolized include omeprazole, phenytoin, diazepam, and propanolol.

It is important to note that it is involved in the formation of hepatotoxic<strong>&nbsp;N-acetyl benzoquinone imine</strong> from <strong>paracetamol.</strong> Chronic alcoholism is responsible for the induction of this enzyme.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This occurs in postcapillary venules. This migration occurs through the inter-endothelial gap towards the chemical concentration gradient created by the chemokines at the site of injury. This occurs with the help of adhesion molecules present in the intercellular junctions such as <strong>platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule</strong> (<strong>PECAM-1</strong>) or <strong>CD31</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>",

This <strong>prevents the formation of&nbsp;UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid</strong> which is the precursor&nbsp;N-acetylmuramic acid. N-acetylmuramic acid is a component of the bacterial cell wall and hence cell wall synthesis is inhibited.</p>\n<p><strong>Cycloserine</strong> inhibits <strong>step 2</strong> in the image.

It is mainly used in the management of tuberculosis where there is resistance to the first-line agents.</p>\n<p><strong>Bacitracin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 3</strong> in the image. It is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor that interferes with&nbsp;<strong>dephosphorylation</strong> in the cycling of the <strong>lipid carrier</strong> which transfers&nbsp;peptidoglycan subunits to the growing cell wall.

This is referred to as post-transcriptional&nbsp;<strong>gene silencing or RNA interference.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RNA interference(RNAi)</strong> is a biological process in which <strong>miRNA or siRNA</strong> molecules inhibit gene expression by neutralizing targeted mRNAs.The&nbsp;microRNA&nbsp;(miRNA) belongs to a group of&nbsp;non-coding genes.&nbsp;The miRNA genes are transcribed but not translated into proteins. They play a role in the regulation of the expression of the target gene by&nbsp;post-transcriptional&nbsp;silencing.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>&nbsp;<strong>gene</strong>&nbsp;present in the nucleus is transcribed to&nbsp;<strong>primary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>, which is further converted to&nbsp;<strong>pre-miRNA</strong>&nbsp;by an enzyme<strong>&nbsp;DROSHA&nbsp;</strong>intranuclearly and exported to the cytoplasm by an export protein called <strong>Exportin 5</strong>.</li>\n<li>The pre-miRNA undergoes trimming, by an enzyme called&nbsp;<strong>DICER</strong>, into&nbsp;<strong>mature</strong>&nbsp;<strong>single-stranded</strong>&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>.</li>\n<li>The mature miRNA is associated with a multiprotein aggregate called&nbsp;<strong>RNA-induced silencing complex</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>RISC</strong>).</li>\n<li>The target mRNAs contain seed sequences in their&nbsp;<strong>3&prime; untranslated region (UTR)&nbsp;</strong>that determines the specificity of miRNA binding and gene silencing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the base pairing between the miRNA strand and its target mRNA, the RISC causes gene silencing either by&nbsp;<strong>mRNA</strong>&nbsp;<strong>cleavage&nbsp;</strong>(degradation or deadenylation)&nbsp;or by&nbsp;<strong>repressing its translation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>siRNA </strong>is<strong> similar </strong>in function to miRNA and is used in <strong>RNA interference.</strong></p>\n<p>miRNA expression has been found to be dysregulated in many cancers. Such misregulation is thought to have a causal role in the pathogenesis of such cancers. Some types of miRNAs are oncogenic (referred to as oncomiRs) and are overexpressed in cancerous tissue. On the other hand, tumor-suppressive miRNAs that counteract oncogenic characteristics are found to be underexpressed in cancers.</p>",

HCM is characterized by reduced stroke volume due to impaired diastolic filling, which is a consequence of the massively hypertrophic left ventricle.

There is a harsh systolic ejection murmur caused by the ventricular outflow obstruction.&nbsp;Mutations causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are most commonly seen in the genes encoding <strong>&beta;-myosin heavy chain </strong>(MHC/MYH7)&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>myosin-binding protein C</strong> (MYBP-C).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>HCM is mostly an <strong>autosomal dominant disorder</strong>.
