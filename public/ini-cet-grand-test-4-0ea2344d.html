These cells are&nbsp;stellate mesenchymal pacemaker cells with smooth muscle-like features. In the stomach and small intestine, they are located in the outer circular muscle layer near the myenteric plexus, in the colon, they are at the submucosal border of the circular muscle layer. The BER is seen in all sites of gastrointestinal smooth muscle <strong>except </strong>in the<strong> esophagus and proximal stomach.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The rate of BER</strong> in various sites is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stomach: 4/min</li>\n<li>Duodenum: 12/min</li>\n<li>Distal ileum: 8/min</li>\n<li>Cecum: 2/min</li>\n<li>Sigmoid colon: 6/min</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Spike potentials on BER:</strong></p>\n<p>The<strong> BER </strong>does<strong> not cause contraction</strong> of the smooth muscle. However, when the BER is superimposed by the spike potentials, it increases muscle tension.

After <strong>vagotomy</strong> or transection of the stomach wall, for example, peristalsis in the <strong>stomach becomes irregular and chaotic.</strong></p>",

The primary advantage of mediolateral episiotomy over midline episiotomy is that there is a <strong>lesser chance of anal sphincter involvement</strong>&nbsp;due to extension.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An <strong>episiotomy</strong> is an <strong>intended incision</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>perineum</strong> with the goal of enlargement of the vaginal opening for birth. Prior to episiotomy, analgesia is provided by existing labor regional analgesia, <strong>bilateral pudendal nerve block</strong>, or local infiltration with 1% lignocaine. Typically, an episiotomy is <strong>completed</strong> <strong>when</strong> the <strong>head is visible</strong> during a contraction to a diameter of 4 to 5 cm.</p>\n<p>Midline episiotomy begins at the fourchette, incises the perineal body in the midline, and ends well before the external anal sphincter. Mediolateral episiotomy begins at the midline of the fourchette and is <strong>directed to the right or left at an angle of 60 degrees</strong> off the midline. This angle accounts for the stretch distortion of the perineal anatomy during crowning. After delivery and resolution of the distortion, it ultimately yields an incision 45 degrees from the midline for suturing.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 173px; width: 407px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 30px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 181px; height: 30px;\"><strong>Midline episiotomy</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 210px; height: 30px;\"><strong>Mediolateral episiotomy</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 181px; height: 18px;\">Surgical repair is easy</td>\n<td style=\"width: 210px; height: 18px;\">Surgical repair is <strong>difficult</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 181px; height: 18px;\">Blood loss is less</td>\n<td style=\"width: 210px; height: 18px;\">Blood loss is<strong> more</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 181px; height: 18px;\">Healing is superior</td>\n<td style=\"width: 210px; height: 18px;\">Healing is not so good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 36px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 181px; height: 36px;\">Dyspareunia is rare</td>\n<td style=\"width: 210px; height: 36px;\">Dyspareunia is comparatively <strong>more</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 57.375px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 181px; height: 57.375px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Postoperative pain is less</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 210px; height: 57.375px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Postoperative pain is <strong>more</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 64px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 181px; height: 64px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Extension, if occurs, may involve the anal sphincter</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 210px; height: 64px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Extension, even if it occurs, will <strong>not involve the anal sphincter</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Patients&nbsp;present commonly by 3-4 months of age with<strong>&nbsp;hypoglycemia&nbsp;</strong>(leading to&nbsp;<strong>seizures</strong>),<strong>&nbsp;lactic acidosis,&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>hepatomegaly.&nbsp;</strong>Affected children often have a<strong>&nbsp;doll-like face</strong>&nbsp;with fat cheeks, relatively thin extremities, short stature, and a protuberant abdomen due to&nbsp;<strong>massive hepatomegaly.&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;<strong>kidneys&nbsp;</strong>are also<strong>&nbsp;enlarged,&nbsp;</strong>whereas the spleen and heart are not involved.&nbsp;Laboratory findings include&nbsp;hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis,<strong>&nbsp;hyperuricemia,&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>hyperlipidemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tarui disease</strong>&nbsp;(Type VII glycogen storage disorder)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>occurs due to the deficiency of <strong>phosphofructokinase</strong>. The main clinical features are exercise intolerance, cramps,&nbsp;<strong>hemolytic anemia,</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>myoglobinuria</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>McArdle disease&nbsp;</strong>(Type V glycogen storage disorder)&nbsp;occurs due to&nbsp;<strong>myophosphorylase</strong>&nbsp;deficiency. It appears in&nbsp;<strong>late childhood</strong>&nbsp;or the second decade of life. The typical manifestations are muscle pain and cramps after heavy exercise. This pain may reduce after a brief period of rest and the patient may be able to perform an exercise. This is called the&nbsp;<strong>second wind phenomenon</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Glycogen debranching enzyme deficiency</strong>&nbsp;is seen in&nbsp;<strong>Cori's disease</strong> (type III glycogen storage disorder). Failure to debranch glycogen into glucose subunits results in the accumulation of abnormal glycogen with short outer-branch chains which resemble<strong> limit dextrin</strong>.
