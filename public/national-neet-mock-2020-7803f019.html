ACTH-independent hypercortisolism is mainly caused by adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma.</p>\n<p>Exogenous hypercortisolism due to the prolonged use of glucocorticoids is the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome.</p>\n<p>Excess cortisol increases the rate of gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and insulin resistance.&nbsp;Cortisol directly affects the transcription and translation of enzyme proteins involved in the metabolism of fats, glycogen, protein synthesis, and Krebs' cycle. The excess catabolism of proteins causes <strong>purplish striae</strong> of the torso, osteoporosis, and poor wound healing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>24-h urine-free cortisol</strong> (UFC) can detect endogenous overproduction of cortisol and is used as a <strong>screening test</strong>. An overnight&nbsp;<strong>1-mg</strong> dexamethasone suppression test (Option C) can be used to identify patients with hypercortisolism.</p>\n<p>Elevated midnight serum or salivary samples of cortisol are suggestive of Cushing&rsquo;s disease. <strong>But, in smokers, late-night salivary cortisol</strong> can be falsely high (Option B) due to the inhibition of 11-beta-hydroxy dehydrogenase on the salivary gland, and hence it is not confirmatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Basal plasma ACTH levels distinguish patients</strong> with ACTH-independent (adrenal glucocorticoid) from those with ACTH-dependent (pituitary ACTH) Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome. Mean basal ACTH levels are higher in patients with ectopic ACTH secretion. &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Following dynamic tests are used to&nbsp;distinguish between ectopic and pituitary sources of excess ACTH:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ACTH stimulation in response to CRH&nbsp;</strong></li>\n<li>Differential sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors are &lt;5 mm in diameter, and about 50% are undetectable by sensitive MRI.</p>\n<p><strong>Tapering exogenous steroids</strong> is the best therapy for iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. The treatment of choice for <strong>Cushing's disease</strong> is <strong>selective transsphenoidal resection,</strong> and<strong> radiotherapy</strong> can be used in failed transsphenoidal surgery.</p>",
