Compression on the retinal vasculature can cause severe vision loss.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Postretrobulbar block apnea syndrome</strong>: This may occur if the anesthetic is injected into the optic nerve sheath.</li>\n<li>Perforation of the globe</li>\n<li>Oculocardiac reflex</li>\n<li>Accidental intravascular injection of the local anesthetic</li>\n<li>Respiratory arrest</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contraindications</strong> of retrobulbar block:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bleeding disorders - This is because of the risk of retrobulbar hemorrhage&nbsp;</li>\n<li>High myopia - Increased length of the globe increases the risk of perforation</li>\n<li>Open eye injury (penetrating eye injury) - injection of local anesthetic behind the globe could increase the intraocular pressure which could lead to extrusion of the orbital contents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Retinal detachment</strong>: Can present with non-specific symptoms initially, but later present with photopsia (transient flashes of light), floaters (small moving spots in the retinal field), or a gradually developing veil/ curtain obscuring field of vision.</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Subconjunctival haemorrhage</strong>: It is usually asymptomatic, but a momentary sharp pain or a snapping sensation can be felt. It is seen on elderly individuals and occurs either spontaneously or follows trauma, surgery or conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Optic neuritis</strong>: It is characterised by loss of vision, deteriorating in hours to days, along with local tenderness. Often the vision improves spontaneously.</p>",
