The next best step is to administer an <strong>intravenous (IV) beta-blocker</strong> for<strong> rate control</strong> as the patient is <strong>hemodynamically stable.</strong></p>\n<p>The initial management of atrial flutter targets rate control through IV atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agents. These include <strong>beta-blockers</strong> or <strong>non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB)</strong> such as <strong>verapamil</strong> and <strong>diltiazem</strong>. Intravenous <strong>ibutilide</strong>, a class III antiarrhythmic agent can be used for <strong>rhythm control</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the patient presents with severe symptoms or is hemodynamically unstable, <strong>electrical cardioversion</strong> is the first step.\u00a0If the episode <strong>duration is &gt; 48 hours</strong>,\u00a0or\u00a0if the patient has an increased risk of <strong>thromboembolic stroke</strong> based on the\u00a0<strong>CHAD2DS2 -VASc\u00a0</strong>scoring\u00a0system, <strong>anticoagulation</strong>\u00a0must be provided before the cardioversion. The drugs which can be used are<strong> direct oral anticoagulants</strong> (DOAC) such as <strong>apixaban</strong>, edoxaban, and <strong>rivaroxaban</strong>. <strong>Dabigatran</strong>, an antithrombin inhibitor, and <strong>warfarin</strong>, a vitamin K antagonist can also be used.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first episode does not warrant the continuation of antiarrhythmic drugs after conversion to sinus rhythm.

Patients with risk factors for thromboembolism should continue it for longer. The definitive treatment is <strong>catheter ablation\u00a0</strong>for recurrent cases.</p>\n<p>The ECG shows characteristic sawtooth flutter waves due to the atrial activity in the inferior leads ( leads II, III, and aVF). Positive P waves are seen in lead V1. Conduction of more than 230 impulses/ minute through the AV node is not possible in adults. Hence a <strong>2:1</strong> or<strong> greater AV block</strong> is almost always associated. So patients present with tachycardia of <strong>130-150 beats/minute.\u00a0</strong>Typically, the\u00a0atrial rate\u00a0is around\u00a0<strong>240-300/minute</strong>.</p>\n<p>Atrial flutter is more commonly seen in patients with <strong>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</strong> or structural heart disease.

Obstruction of biliary ducts may be intrahepatic or extrahepatic and can be localised by imaging techniques. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Bilirubin is the breakdown product of heme metabolism which is formed in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver. It is insoluble in water and is known as <strong>unconjugated</strong> (indirect) bilirubin. It is transported to the liver after binding to <strong>albumin,\u00a0</strong>where\u00a0it undergoes conjugation with glucuronic acid. The final product is known as <strong>conjugated bilirubin</strong> (direct bilirubin) which drains into the duodenum. On reaching the colon, the unconjugated form is acted upon by <strong>bacterial beta glucuronidases\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0reduced into colorless<strong> urobilinogen</strong>.

However, in obstructive jaundice, bilirubin cannot drain to the intestine to be converted into urobilinogen. Thus, fecal urobilinogen is absent, which gives the characteristic clay-colored stools.

They act by&nbsp;<strong>inhibiting&nbsp;</strong>the<strong>&nbsp;Na+/K+/2Cl- symporter</strong>&nbsp;in the <strong>ascending limb</strong> of the loop of Henle.</p>\n<p>This leads to a&nbsp;decrease in preload&nbsp;by&nbsp;increasing sodium and water excretion<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and improves ventricular function by reducing the circulatory volume. Intravenous furosemide also<strong>&nbsp;</strong>increases systemic venous capacitance.</p>\n<p>The history of a patient who is known to have&nbsp;<strong>congestive heart failure</strong>&nbsp;being brought with complaints of&nbsp;<strong>sudden onset dyspnoea</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;bilateral fine basal crackles</strong>&nbsp;is suggestive of&nbsp;<strong>pulmonary edema.&nbsp;</strong>Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump an adequate cardiac output for meeting physiological demands and can occur due to systolic/diastolic dysfunction.

The symptoms include <strong>fever </strong>with <strong>chills</strong>, <strong>malaise, </strong>and <strong>dyspnea</strong>. There is <strong>complete resolution of the symptoms</strong> within hours to days if there is no further exposure to the antigen.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>In <strong>subacute HP</strong>, the systemic and pulmonary <strong>symptoms develop insidiously</strong> <strong>over </strong>a <strong>few weeks</strong>, like in this patient. <strong>Complete resolution of symptoms</strong> is seen here as well, but it takes a longer time.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Chronic</strong> <strong>HP </strong>presents with an<strong> even slower course</strong> &mdash; with cough, dyspnea,<strong> weight loss</strong>, and <strong>clubbing of digits</strong>.

For <strong>severely</strong> symptomatic infants, <strong>surgical interventions</strong> such as tongue advancement, mandibular distraction osteogenesis, or tracheotomy may be necessary.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 372\">\u00a0</div>",
