Multinucleated giant cells with <strong>faceted nuclei</strong> and <strong>homogeneously stained 'ground glass' chromatin</strong>\u00a0known as Tzanck cells are seen.</p>\n<p>The given condition is genital herpes which may be caused by both types of HSV but is<strong> more commonly caused by Type 2</strong>.</p>\n<p>HSV 1 is usually isolated from lesions in and around the mouth and is transmitted by <strong>direct contact or droplet spread</strong> from cases or carriers. HSV 2 is responsible for majority of <strong>genital herpes</strong> infections and is commonly transmitted venereally.</p>\n<p>Differentiating features between the two types is mostly demonstrated in a laboratory set-up where the <strong>infectivity </strong>of<strong> type 2</strong> is<strong> more temperature sensitive </strong>than that of<strong> type 1</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Transmission :</p>\n<p>The virus enters through defects in the skin or mucous membranes and enters cutaneous nerve fibres and is transported intra-axonally to the ganglia where it replicates. The virus remains latent in the ganglia, particularly the<strong> trigeminal (type 1)</strong> and the<strong> sacral (type 2)</strong> nerves to be reactivated periodically causing recurrent oral and genital lesions.</p>\n<p>The typical herpes lesions are thin-walled, umbilicated vesicles, the roof of which breaks down, leaving tiny superficial ulcers . They heal without scarring.\u00a0The most common site of cutaneous lesions is the face - on the cheeks, chin, around the mouth or on the forehead.</p>\n<p>HSV 2 infection confers some protection against HSV 1,<strong> but not vice versa.</strong></p>\n<p>The clinical course depends on the site of the infection, age and immune status of the host and the type of virus. It can either be cutaneous, mucosal, ophthalmic, neuologic, visceral, genetic or congenital.</p>\n<p>Transplacental infection can occur with both types but is quite rare. Infection can occur during birth if the mother has genital lesions due to HSV 2. Cesarean section is done to prevent infection. <strong>Postnatal infection </strong>is more<strong> commonly </strong>due to<strong> type 1</strong>. The mortality rate of neonatal herpes is quite high and may leave neurological impairments.</p>",

This is called the Bezold Jarisch reflex and can be elicited by&nbsp;capsaicin, serotonin, phenylbiguanide, and veratridine. It can also be activated during myocardial infarction and on exposure to radioactive dyes during coronary angiography.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option A- C fibre endings close to the pulmonary vessels are called <strong>J (juxtacapillary) receptors</strong>. These receptors are stimulated by hyperinflation of the lungs or intravenous administration of capsaicin. The reflex produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia and hypotension. This is called the <strong>J reflex.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option B-<strong> Cushing reflex</strong> is the <strong>increased blood pressure</strong> and <strong>bradycardia</strong> seen in patients with raised intracranial pressure. Increased intracranial pressure compresses the cerebral blood vessels and causes <strong>hypercapnia</strong>. This stimulates the central chemoreceptors located in the ventrolateral surface of the medulla and causes increased blood pressure. This increase is proportional to the increase in the intracranial pressure. Increased blood pressure stimulates baroreceptors and causes bradycardia.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C- <strong>Brainbridge reflex</strong> is the <strong>increase</strong> in the <strong>heart rate</strong> when the atrium is <strong>stretched. </strong>Whenever there is a stretch of the atrium, the stretch receptors are activated. They transmit their afferent signals through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. Efferent signals are then transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase the heart rate and strength of heart contraction. This reflex prevents the accumulation of blood in the atria, veins and pulmonary circulation.</p>",

Statements<strong> 1 and 3</strong> are <strong>true</strong> regarding the thyroid hormone.</p>\n<p>Synthesis- Iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormone. Absorbed iodine is taken by the thyroid follicular cells with the help of a<strong> sodium iodide</strong> transporter (<strong>NIS</strong>). NIS is mainly present in the <strong>thyroid gland</strong>, but it can also be present in&nbsp;<strong>salivary glands, lactating breast, and placenta.&nbsp;</strong>NIS is not present in the pituitary gland.</p>\n<p>The iodine that enters the thyroid gland undergoes organification and is added to tyrosyl residues within thyroglobulin. These iodotyrosines are then coupled to form T4 and T3 hormones. This reaction is catalyzed by <strong>thyroid peroxidase.</strong> After coupling, the thyroglobulin is taken back into the cells to release T4 and T3. Uncoupled mono and diiodotyrosines are deiodinated by the enzyme dehalogenase to recycle iodine.</p>\n<p>T3 and T4 are the two forms of the hormone.<strong> T4</strong> is present in<strong> higher concentrations</strong> and has a <strong>longer half-life</strong> than T3. However,<strong> T3 is more potent</strong> than T4.</p>\n<p>Thyroid hormones enter the cell by passive diffusion or by the transporters.
