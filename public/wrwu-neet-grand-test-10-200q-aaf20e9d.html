Success in day surgery requires each component of the pathway to be safe and efficient and to be performed in sequence. Unplanned overnight admissions are minimized by ensuring that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The patient is informed and fit for the procedure</li>\n<li>The procedure itself is achievable as a day case</li>\n<li>The procedure is scheduled early on the operating list to allow safe recovery and discharge</li>\n<li>The home environment can support a postoperative ambulatory patient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anesthetic considerations:</p>\n<p>The <strong>IV anesthetic</strong> of choice for daycare surgery is <strong>propofol</strong>\u00a0due to its <strong>smooth induction</strong> and <strong>rapid recovery</strong>. The antiemetic action is also beneficial. <strong>Thiopental</strong> results in <strong>prolonged postoperative sedation</strong> and is not preferred in ambulatory anesthesia Benzodiazepines and ketamine are avoided for similar reasons.</p>\n<p>The <strong>inhalational anesthetic</strong> of choice for daycare surgery is <strong>sevoflurane</strong>. The low blood-gas partition coefficient, blood-brain coefficient, and minimal airway irritation of sevoflurane promote rapid induction and rapid recovery. Desflurane is also associated with faster recovery but its irritant effect on the upper airway with risk of laryngospasm prevents its use as an induction agent.</p>\n<p><strong>Rocuronium</strong> is an intermediate-acting muscle relaxant with a <strong>rapid onset</strong> which is used in <strong>daycare</strong> anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide surgical relaxation. Its actions can be terminated by the reversal agent<strong> sugammadex</strong> which produces a rapid and complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade.</p>\n<p><strong>Succinylcholine</strong> is the shortest-acting muscle relaxant but it has a high incidence of <strong>postoperative myalgia</strong>. So its use in daycare anesthesia is discouraged.</p>\n<p><strong>Analgesics: Paracetamol </strong>and other <strong>NSAIDs </strong>are preferred to manage pain in daycare procedures since opioids increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). However, short-acting opioids like <strong>remifentanil</strong>\u00a0can be used if adequate pain control is not achieved with NSAIDs. <strong>Morphine</strong> is a long-acting opioid and therefore it should be avoided in daycare surgery to reduce the incidence of <strong>PONV</strong>.</p>",
