    "solution": "<p>Insulin secretion is <strong>dependent</strong> on <strong>intracellular ATP</strong> concentrations.</p>\n<p>On food intake, there is subsequent uptake of glucose by the pancreatic beta islet cells. The glucose molecules undergo cytoplasmic glycolysis (glucokinase-mediated) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate <strong>ATP</strong>. This ATP reenters the cytoplasm where it <strong>inhibits the ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels</strong>.</p>\n<p>Reduction of K<sup>+</sup> influx leads to retention of intracellular positive charge and consequent beta-cell membrane depolarization. This results in&nbsp;<strong>Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry</strong> (via voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) that promotes <strong>exocytosis</strong> of secretory granules containing the insulin hormone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Insulin promotes <strong>intracellular movement </strong>of <strong>potassium.</strong> This is believed to be due to a mechanism that involves insulin-mediated activation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase that promotes K<sup>+</sup> influx into the cell, resulting in hypokalemia. Potassium plays an important role in <strong>insulin secretion</strong> from beta cells in the pancreatic islets as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: Insulin binds to transmembrane receptors that have tyrosine kinase activity in their intracellular subunits. There is subsequent autophosphorylation of these subunits that mediate the biological effects of insulin. One of the consequences is the<strong> growth-promoting</strong> protein anabolic effects carried out by&nbsp;<strong>phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>C peptide&nbsp;</strong>is the peptide segment that connects the A and B chains of the insulin (proinsulin). Once hormone granules are exocytosed from the beta islet cells, proinsulin is cleaved so as to be <strong>released </strong>in <strong>equimolar concentrations</strong> of insulin and C peptide.&nbsp;</p>",

The antibody against a specific antigen can lead to cellular destruction by either <strong>opsonization</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>phagocytosis,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>complement activation, or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)</strong>. In ADCC, cells coated with IgG antibodies are killed by effector cells like NK cells and macrophages.
